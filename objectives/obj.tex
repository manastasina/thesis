\section{Objectives of the present study}

The objective of the present study was to provide novel insights into modulation of influenza A virus-host cell interactions by NS1 and to utilize that knowledge further. The specific aims were:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To study the functional role of the NS1 nucleic acid binding in transcriptional control of cellular genes
		
		\item To understand how NS1 regulates protein synthesis
		
		\item To determine the contribution of NS1 C-terminus to viral replication and pathogenicity
		
		\item To utilize understanding of translational modulation by NS1 for improvement of a biotechnologically important cell-free protein synthesis system
		
	\end{enumerate}
