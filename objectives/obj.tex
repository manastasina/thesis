\section{Objectives of the present study}

The objective of the present study was to provide novel insights in several aspects of virus-host cell interactions control by NS1 and find the way to utilize to possible knowledge obtained. The specific aims were:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To study the functional role of the conservative NS1 nucleic acid binding in transcriptional control of cellular genes;
		
		\item To understand the how NS1 regulates protein synthesis;
		
		\item To determine the contribution of NS1 C-terminus to viral replication and pathogenicity;
		
		\item To utilize understanding of translational modulation by NS1 for improvement of biotechnologically important cell-free protein synthesis system.
		
	\end{enumerate}
