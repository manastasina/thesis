\section{Objectives of the present study}

The objective of the present study was to provide novel insights in several aspects of virus-host cell interactions control by NS1 and find the way to utilize to possible knowledge obtained. The specific aims were:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To understand the mechanism by which NS1 protein of Influenza A virus controls transcription of host genes;
		
		\item To understand how NS1 modulates post-transcriptional processing of cellular mRNAs and synthesis of proteins in the infected cell;
		
		\item To understand the contribution of NS1 C-terminus in control of host antiviral responses;
		
		\item To utilize understanding of translational modulation by NS1 for improvement of biotechnologically important cell-free protein synthesis system.
		
	\end{enumerate}
