abstract = {At the global level, influenza A virus (IAV) is considered a major health threat because it causes significant morbidity. Different treatment and prevention options have been developed; however, these are insufficient in the face of recent IAV outbreaks. In particular, available antiviral agents have limited effectiveness owing to IAV resistance to these virus-directed drugs. Recent advances in understanding of IAV replication have revealed a number of cellular drug targets that counteract viral drug resistance. This review summarizes current knowledge on IAV replication with a focus on emerging cellular drug targets. Interestingly, for many of these targets, compounds for which safety testing has been carried out in humans are available. It is possible that some of these compounds, such as inhibitors of heat shock protein 90, proteasome, importin $\alpha$5 or protein kinase C, will be used for treatment of IAV infections after careful evaluation in human primary cells and severely ill flu patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Primer-independent cDNA synthesis during reverse transcription hinders quantitative analysis of bidirectional mRNA synthesis in eukaryotes as well as in cells infected with RNA viruses. We report a simple RT-PCR-based assay for strand-specific gene-expression analysis. By modifying the cDNA sequence during reverse transcription, the opposite strands of target sequences can be simultaneously detected by postamplification melting curve analysis and primer-initiated transcripts are readily distinguished from nonspecifically primed cDNA. We have utilized this technique to optimize the specificity of reverse transcription on a panel of 15 target genes. Primer-independent reverse transcription occurred for all target sequences when reverse transcription was performed at 42°C and accounted for 11\%-57\% of the final PCR amplification products. By raising the reaction temperature to 55°C, the specificity of reverse transcription could be increased without significant loss of sensitivity. We have also demonstrated the utility of this technique for analysis of (+) and (-) RNA synthesis of influenza A virus in infected cells. Thus, this technique represents a powerful tool for analysis of bidirectional RNA synthesis.},

abstract = {The nonstructural protein NS1 of influenza A virus blocks the development of host antiviral responses by inhibiting polyadenylation of cellular pre-mRNA. NS1 also promotes the synthesis of viral proteins by stimulating mRNA translation. Here, we show that recombinant NS1 proteins of human pandemic H1N1/2009, avian highly pathogenic H5N1, and low pathogenic H5N2 influenza strains differentially affected these two cellular processes: NS1 of the two avian strains, in contrast to NS1 of H1N1/2009, stimulated translation of reporter mRNA in cell-free translation system; NS1 of H5N1 was an effective inhibitor of cellular pre-mRNA polyadenylation in A549 cells, unlike NS1 of H5N2 and H1N1/2009. We identified key amino acids in NS1 that contribute to its activity in these two basic cellular processes. Thus, we identified strain-specific differences between influenza virus NS1 proteins in pre-mRNA polyadenylation and mRNA translation.},

abstract = {Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) is a mammalian cell-free system for protein production. However, one of the limitations of this system is its low protein yield. Inclusion of recombinant virus proteins and specific viral structures on target mRNA could enhance protein production in RRL. Here we show that simultaneous addition of influenza A virus NS1 protein and inclusion of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the target mRNA facilitate translation initiation and increase protein yield over 10-fold, improving the translation capacity of RRL.},
