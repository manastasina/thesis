abstract = {DNA microarray platforms for gene expression profiling were invented$\backslash$nrelatively recently and breast cancer has been among the earliest$\backslash$nand most intensely studied diseases using this technology. The molecular$\backslash$nsignatures so identified help reveal the biologic spectrum of breast$\backslash$ncancers, provide diagnostic tools as well as prognostic and predictive$\backslash$ngene signatures, and may identify new therapeutic targets. Data are$\backslash$nbest presented in an open access format to facilitate external validation,$\backslash$nthe most crucial step in identifying robust, reproducible gene signatures$\backslash$nsuitable for clinical translation. Clinically practical applications$\backslash$nderived from full expression profile Studies already in use include$\backslash$nreduced versions of microarrays representing key discriminatory genes$\backslash$nand therapeutic targets, quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays,$\backslash$nor immunohistochemical Surrogate panels (suitable for application$\backslash$nto standard pathology blocks). Prospective trials are now underway$\backslash$nto determine the value of such tools for clinical decision making$\backslash$nin breast cancer; these efforts may serve as a model for using such$\backslash$napproaches in other tumor types.},

@article{Corsten2012,
abstract = {Viral myocarditis is an important cause of heart failure for which no specific treatments are available. Direct viral injury to cardiac cells provokes an inflammatory response that significantly contributes to cardiac damage and ensuing morbidity. Despite the central pathogenic role of autoimmune injury, broad inhibition of the inflammatory response does not result in patient benefit. Many preclinical studies collectively emphasize that modulating distinct inflammatory signaling pathways may yield effective viral clearance while preserving cardiac structure. This review aims to provide an overview of the sometimes contrasting observations from experimental viral myocarditis models and to translate the lessons learned into opportunities for future investigations and therapies. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart frequently resulting from viral infections and/or post-viral immune-mediated responses. It is one of the important causes of dilated cardiomyopathy worldwide. The diagnosis is presumed on clinical presentation and noninvasive diagnostic methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard for in vivo diagnosis of myocarditis. The therapeutic and prognostic benefits of endomyocardial biopsy results have recently been demonstrated in several clinical trials. Although remarkable advances in diagnosis, understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment of acute myocarditis were gained during the last years, no standard treatment strategies could be defined as yet, apart from standard heart failure therapy and physical rest. In severe cases, mechanical support or heart transplantation may become necessary. There is some evidence that immunosuppressive and immunomodulating therapy are effective for chronic, virus-negative inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Further investigations by controlled, randomized studies are needed to definitively determine their role in the treatment of myocarditis. ?? 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

@article{Lauer1997,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated whether myocyte injury can be assessed sensitively by measurement of serum levels of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis and whether cTnT levels may predict the results of histologic and immunohistologic analysis of endomyocardial biopsy specimens. BACKGROUND: Conventionally used laboratory variables often fail to show myocyte injury in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, possibly because of a low extent of myocardial injury in these patients. Sensitive variables for myocyte injury have not yet been investigated. METHODS: Eighty patients with clinically suspected myocarditis were screened for creatine kinase (CK) activity, MB isoform of CK (CK-MB) activity and cTnT. Endomyocardial biopsy specimens were examined histologically and immunohistologically. RESULTS: cTnT was elevated in 28 of 80 patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, CK in 4 and CK-MB in 1. Histologic analysis alone of the endomyocardial biopsy specimen revealed evidence of myocarditis in only five patients, all with elevated cTnT levels. Twenty-three of 28 patients with elevated cTnT levels had histologically negative findings for myocarditis. Additional immunohistologic analysis revealed evidence of myocarditis in 26 (93\%) of 28 patients with elevated cTnT levels and in 23 (44\%) of 52 patients with normal cTnT levels. Mean cTnT levels were higher in patients with myocarditis proved histologically or immunohistologically, or both, than in patients without myocarditis (0.59 +/- 1.68 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.05, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of serum levels of cTnT provides evidence of myocyte injury in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis more sensitively than does conventional determination of cardiac enzyme levels. Myocardial cell damage may be present even in the absence of histologic signs of myocarditis. Additional immunohistologic analysis often shows lymphocytic infiltrates in these patients. Elevated levels of cTnT are highly predictive for myocarditis in this group.},

@article{Emdin2009,
abstract = {Heart failure (HF) may be considered as the fatal finishing line of all cardiovascular disorders. Despite advances in the understanding and treatment, it still has a poor prognosis. Heart failure is a syndrome, rather than a primary diagnosis, which results from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the heart to support the physiological circulation. This is sustained by a chronic imbalance in the neurohormonal control of circulation. Unfortunately, there is no single diagnostic test for HF, and the accuracy of diagnosis by clinical means only (i.e. a combination of history, physical examination and appropriate investigations) is often inadequate. Diagnosis and risk stratification depend on the availability of accurate, and effective markers of either risk or disease. There is an increasing interest in the development of new biomarkers, and a great number of laboratory tests have recently been proposed. The goals of this 'commentary' are to (i) briefly discuss the characteristics of an ideal HF biomarker; (ii) describe the analytical performance and clinical relevance of currently available biomarker assay methods, (iii) evaluate newer biomarkers and finally, (iv) design a scheme to optimize the search for efficient diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for HF.},
