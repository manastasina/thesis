abstract = {Influenza epidemics and pandemics have a huge impact on society and individuals. The weight and scope of the burden of influenza varies with the age and underlying health of the patient. The disease imposes a significant burden on all individuals, but hospitalization and treatment occur more frequently in high-risk patients (the elderly and those with certain underlying medical conditions); patient populations that are increasing in size. Escalating medical costs have increased the need to quantify the burden of influenza. The first step in any such analysis is to determine the incidence of the disease; with influenza, this is often under-reported, since the illness may be confused with other viral illnesses. In addition to the direct costs of medical care, the indirect costs of influenza are substantial and stem largely from absenteeism and loss of work productivity. Estimates of the cost of influenza in the USA, France and Germany have shown that indirect costs can be five- to 10-fold higher than direct costs. Other intangible costs associated with influenza include impaired performance, which can reduce reaction times, and adverse effects on the quality of life of patients and their families. The costs of interventions should, therefore, be considered in this context. The main approach to the control of influenza and its associated costs is the administration of vaccines. Although vaccines are widely effective, the greatest potential benefits are observed within high-risk groups; vaccination is therefore recommended in many countries for high-risk patients, their carers and healthcare workers. However, the shortcomings of present vaccines, which include manufacturing limitations that prevent guaranteed adequate supply of vaccine, the difficulty in matching vaccines to circulating strains and the need for administration by injection, highlight the need for complementary treatment.},

abstract = {Background: Despite preventive efforts, influenza epidemics are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality every year in the United States (US). Vaccination strategies to reduce disease burden have been implemented. However, no previous studies have systematically estimated the annual economic burden of influenza epidemics, an estimate necessary to guide policy makers effectively. Objective: We estimate age- and risk-specific disease burden, and medical and indirect costs attributable to annual influenza epidemics in the United States. Methods: Using a probabilistic model and publicly available epidemiological data we estimated the number of influenza-attributable cases leading to outpatient visits, hospitalization, and mortality, as well as time lost from work absenteeism or premature death. With data from health insurance claims and projections of either earnings or statistical life values, we then estimated healthcare resource utilization associated with influenza cases as were their medical and productivity (indirect) costs in \$2003. Results: Based on 2003 US population, we estimated that annual influenza epidemics resulted in an average of 610,660 life-years lost (undiscounted), 3.1 million hospitalized days, and 31.4 million outpatient visits. Direct medical costs averaged \$10.4 billion (95\% confidence interval [C.I.], \$4.1, \$22.2) annually. Projected lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amounted to \$16.3 billion (C.I., \$8.7, \$31.0) annually. The total economic burden of annual influenza epidemics using projected statistical life values amounted to \$87.1 billion (C.I., \$47.2, \$149.5). Conclusions: These results highlight the enormous annual burden of influenza in the US. While hospitalization costs are important contributors, lost productivity from missed work days and lost lives comprise the bulk of the economic burden of influenza. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
