abstract = {Inhibition of the nuclear export of poly(A)-containing mRNAs caused by the influenza A virus NS1 protein requires its effector domain. Here, we demonstrate that the NS1 effector domain functionally interacts with the cellular 30 kDa subunit of CPSF, an essential component of the 3' end processing machinery of cellular pre-mRNAs. In influenza virus-infected cells, the NS1 protein is physically associated with CPSF 30 kDa. Binding of the NS1 protein to the 30 kDa protein in vitro prevents CPSF binding to the RNA substrate and inhibits 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation of host pre-mRNAs. The NS1 protein also inhibits 3' end processing in vivo, and the uncleaved pre-mRNA remains in the nucleus. Via this novel regulation of pre-mRNA 3' end processing, the NS1 protein selectively inhibits the nuclear export of cellular, and not viral, mRNAs.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus NS1 protein, a virus-encoded alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) antagonist, appears to be a key regulator of protein expression in infected cells. We now show that NS1 protein expression results in enhancement of reporter gene activity from transfected plasmids. This effect appears to be mediated at the translational level, and it is reminiscent of the activity of the adenoviral virus-associated I (VAI) RNA, a known inhibitor of the antiviral, IFN-induced, PKR protein. To study the effects of the NS1 protein on viral and cellular protein synthesis during influenza A virus infection, we used recombinant influenza viruses lacking the NS1 gene (delNS1) or expressing truncated NS1 proteins. Our results demonstrate that the NS1 protein is required for efficient viral protein synthesis in COS-7 cells. This activity maps to the amino-terminal domain of the NS1 protein, since cells infected with wild-type virus or with a mutant virus expressing a truncated NS1 protein-lacking approximately half of its carboxy-terminal end-showed similar kinetics of viral and cellular protein expression. Interestingly, no major differences in host cell protein synthesis shutoff or in viral protein expression were found among NS1 mutant viruses in Vero cells. Thus, another viral component(s) different from the NS1 protein is responsible for the inhibition of host protein synthesis during viral infection. In contrast to the earlier proposal suggesting that the NS1 protein regulates the levels of spliced M2 mRNA, no effects on M2 protein accumulation were seen in Vero cells infected with delNS1 virus.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus M1 mRNA is alternatively spliced to produce M2 mRNA, mRNA(3), and in some cases, M4 mRNA. Splicing of influenza mRNAs is carried out by the cellular splicing machinery and is thought to be regulated, as both spliced and unspliced mRNAs encode proteins. In this study, we used radioactively labelled primers to investigate the accumulation of spliced and unspliced M segment mRNAs in viral infection and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) reconstitution assays in which only the minimal components required for transcription and replication to occur were expressed. We found that co-expression of the viral NS1 protein in an RNP reconstitution assay altered the accumulation of spliced mRNAs compared with when it was absent, and that this activity was dependent on the RNA-binding ability of NS1. These findings suggest that the NS1 protein plays a role in the regulation of splicing of influenza virus M1 mRNA.},

abstract = {Viral infection is commonly associated with virus-driven hijacking of host proteins. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which influenza virus affects host cells through the interaction of influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) with the infected cell epigenome. We show that the NS1 protein of influenza A H3N2 subtype possesses a histone-like sequence (histone mimic) that is used by the virus to target the human PAF1 transcription elongation complex (hPAF1C). We demonstrate that binding of NS1 to hPAF1C depends on the NS1 histone mimic and results in suppression of hPAF1C-mediated transcriptional elongation. Furthermore, human PAF1 has a crucial role in the antiviral response. Loss of hPAF1C binding by NS1 attenuates influenza infection, whereas hPAF1C deficiency reduces antiviral gene expression and renders cells more susceptible to viruses. We propose that the histone mimic in NS1 enables the influenza virus to affect inducible gene expression selectively, thus contributing to suppression of the antiviral response.},

abstract = {The emergence of influenza A viruses resistant to the two existing classes of antiviral drugs highlights the need for additional antiviral drugs, particularly considering the potential threat of a pandemic of H5N1 influenza A viruses. Here, we determine whether influenza A virus replication can be selectively inhibited by blocking the ability of its NS1A protein to inhibit the 3'-end processing of cellular pre-mRNAs, including beta interferon (IFN-beta) pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA processing is inhibited via the binding of the NS1A protein to the cellular CPSF30 protein, and mutational inactivation of this NS1A binding site causes severe attenuation of the virus. We demonstrate that binding of CPSF30 is mediated by two of its zinc fingers, F2F3, and that the CPSF30/F2F3 binding site on the NS1A protein extends from amino acid 144 to amino acid 186. We generated MDCK cells that constitutively express epitope-tagged F2F3 in the nucleus, although at only approximately one-eighth the level of the NS1A protein produced during virus infection. Influenza A virus replication was inhibited in this cell line, whereas no inhibition was observed with influenza B virus, whose NS1B protein lacks a binding site for CPSF30. Influenza A virus, but not influenza B virus, induced increased production of IFN-beta mRNA in the F2F3-expressing cells. These results, which indicate that F2F3 inhibits influenza A virus replication by blocking the binding of endogenous CPSF30 to the NS1A protein, point to this NS1A binding site as a potential target for the development of antivirals directed against influenza A virus.},

abstract = {RNA segment 8 (NS) of influenza A virus encodes two proteins. The NS1 protein is translated from the unspliced primary mRNA transcript, whereas the second protein encoded by this segment, NS2/NEP, is translated from a spliced mRNA. Splicing of influenza NS1 mRNA is thought to be regulated so that the levels of NS2 spliced transcripts are approximately 10 \% of total NS mRNA. Regulation of splicing of the NS1 mRNA has been studied at length, and a number of often-contradictory control mechanisms have been proposed. In this study, we used (32)P-labelled gene-specific primers to investigate influenza A NS1 mRNA splicing regulation. It was found that the efficiency of splicing of NS1 mRNA was maintained at similar levels in both virus infection and ribonucleoprotein-reconstitution assays, and NS2 mRNA comprised approximately 15 \% of total NS mRNA in both assays. The effect of NS1 protein expression on the accumulation of viral NS2 mRNA and spliced cellular beta-globin mRNA was analysed, and it was found that NS1 protein expression reduced spliced beta-globin mRNA levels, but had no effect on the accumulation of NS2 mRNA. We conclude that the NS1 protein specifically inhibits the accumulation of cellular RNA polymerase II-driven mRNAs, but does not affect the splicing of its own viral NS1 mRNA.},

abstract = {The NS1A protein of influenza A virus binds the cellular CPSF30 protein, thereby inhibiting the 3'-end processing of all cellular pre-mRNAs, including beta interferon pre-mRNA. X-ray crystallography identified the CPSF30-binding pocket on the influenza virus A/Udorn/72 (Ud) NS1A protein and the critical role of two hydrophobic NS1A amino acids outside the pocket, F103 and M106, in stabilizing the CPSF30-NS1A complex. Although the NS1A protein of the 1997 H5N1 influenza A/Hong Kong/483/97 (HK97) virus contains L (not F) at position 103 and I (not M) at position 106, it binds CPSF30 in vivo to a significant extent because cognate (HK97) internal proteins stabilize the CPSF30-NS1A complex in infected cells. Here we show that the cognate HK97 polymerase complex, containing the viral polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA) and the nucleocapsid protein (NP), is responsible for this stabilization. The noncognate Ud polymerase complex cannot carry out this stabilization, but it can stabilize CPSF30 binding to a mutated (F103L M106I) cognate Ud NS1A protein. These results suggested that the viral polymerase complex is an integral component of the CPSF30-NS1A protein complex in infected cells even when the cognate NS1A protein contains F103 and M106, and we show that this is indeed the case. Finally, we show that cognate PA protein and NP, but not cognate PB1 and PB2 proteins, are required for stabilizing the CPSF30-NS1A complex, indicating that the NS1A protein interacts primarily with its cognate PA protein and NP in a complex that includes the cellular CPSF30 protein.},

abstract = {The NS1 protein of influenza A virus is a major virulence factor that is essential for pathogenesis. NS1 functions to impair innate and adaptive immunity by inhibiting host signal transduction and gene expression, but its mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. We show here that NS1 forms an inhibitory complex with NXF1/TAP, p15/NXT, Rae1/mrnp41, and E1B-AP5, which are key constituents of the mRNA export machinery that interact with both mRNAs and nucleoporins to direct mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex. Increased levels of NXF1, p15, or Rae1 revert the mRNA export blockage induced by NS1. Furthermore, influenza virus down-regulates Nup98, a nucleoporin that is a docking site for mRNA export factors. Reduced expression of these mRNA export factors renders cells highly permissive to influenza virus replication, demonstrating that proper levels of key constituents of the mRNA export machinery protect against influenza virus replication. Because Nup98 and Rae1 are induced by interferons, down-regulation of this pathway is likely a viral strategy to promote viral replication. These findings demonstrate previously undescribed influenza-mediated viral-host interactions and provide insights into potential molecular therapies that may interfere with influenza infection.},

abstract = {Influenza A viruses are major pathogens in humans and in animals, whose genome consists of eight single-stranded RNA segments of negative polarity. Viral mRNAs are synthesized by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in the nucleus of infected cells, in close association with the cellular transcriptional machinery. Two proteins essential for viral multiplication, the exportin NS2/NEP and the ion channel protein M2, are produced by splicing of the NS1 and M1 mRNAs, respectively. Here we identify two human spliceosomal factors, RED and SMU1, that control the expression of NS2/NEP and are required for efficient viral multiplication. We provide several lines of evidence that in infected cells, the hetero-trimeric viral polymerase recruits a complex formed by RED and SMU1 through interaction with its PB2 and PB1 subunits. We demonstrate that the splicing of the NS1 viral mRNA is specifically affected in cells depleted of RED or SMU1, leading to a decreased production of the spliced mRNA species NS2, and to a reduced NS2/NS1 protein ratio. In agreement with the exportin function of NS2, these defects impair the transport of newly synthesized viral ribonucleoproteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and strongly reduce the production of infectious influenza virions. Overall, our results unravel a new mechanism of viral subversion of the cellular splicing machinery, by establishing that the human splicing factors RED and SMU1 act jointly as key regulators of influenza virus gene expression. In addition, our data point to a central role of the viral RNA polymerase in coupling transcription and alternative splicing of the viral mRNAs.},

abstract = {To examine the role of polyadenylation in the nuclear export of mRNA, we have replaced the poly(A) signal in a Rev-responsive human immunodeficiency virus type 1-based reporter gene with a cis-acting hammerhead ribozyme. Transcripts from this gene thus acquire a 3' terminus by cis-ribozyme cleavage rather than by polyadenylation. The nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of transcripts was investigated using transient gene expression and quantitative RNase protection assays. In the absence of Rev, a basal level of polyadenylated unspliced mRNA transcribed from a poly(A) signal-containing control reporter gene was detected in the cytoplasm of transfected COS7 cells. However, cytoplasmic ribozyme-cleaved unspliced RNA was only barely detectable. The nuclear/cytoplasmic (n/c) ratio of polyadenylated RNAs was 3.8, while the n/c ratio for ribozyme cis-cleaved RNAs was 33. The cytoplasmic localization of the polyadenylated unspliced mRNA was enhanced about 10-fold in the presence of Rev and the Rev-responsive element. In marked contrast to this, ribozyme cleaved RNA accumulated almost exclusively (n/c ratio of 28) in the nucleus in the presence of Rev. Actinomycin D time course analysis suggested that the low levels of the cytoplasmic ribozyme-cleaved RNAs in both the presence and absence of Rev were due to serve export deficiency of ribozyme-cleaved RNA. Finally, by inserting a 90-nucleotide poly(A) stretch directly upstream of the ribozyme cassette, we have demonstrated that a long stretch of poly(A) near the 3' end of a ribozyme-cleaved transcript is not sufficient for directing mRNA export. Taken together, these results suggest that polyadenylation is required for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNA and that Rev interaction with the Rev-responsive element cannot bypass this requirement.},

Although the NES sequence is crucial for nuclear export, its exact role in the formation of the ternary export complex is controversial. Here we demonstrate an interaction between human CRM1 (hCRM1) and influenza A virus NS2 protein, which contains an NES motif in its N-terminal region. Replacement of the hydrophobic amino acids in the NES motif did not abolish NS2's interaction with hCRM1. Using our recently established systems for the generation of influenza virus or virus-like particles from cloned cDNAs, we found that NS2 is essential for nuclear export of influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, and that alteration of the NS2-NES abrogated this event and influenza virus generation. These findings suggest that the NS2-NES is not crucial for the interaction of this protein with hCRM1, but is for the formation of the ternary export complex with Ran-GTP.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus NS1 protein (NS1A protein) binds and inhibits the function of the 30-kDa subunit of CPSF, a cellular factor that is required for the 3'-end processing of cellular pre-mRNAs. Here we generate a recombinant influenza A/Udorn/72 virus that encodes an NS1A protein containing a mutated binding site for the 30-kDa subunit of CPSF. This mutant virus is substantially attenuated, indicating that this binding site in the NS1A protein is required for efficient virus replication. Using this mutant virus, we show that NS1A binding to CPSF mediates the viral posttranscriptional countermeasure against the initial cellular antiviral response--the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta)-independent activation of the transcription of cellular antiviral genes, which requires the interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) transcription factor that is activated by virus infection. Whereas the posttranscriptional processing of these cellular antiviral pre-mRNAs is inhibited in cells infected by wild-type influenza A virus, functional antiviral mRNAs are produced in cells infected by the mutant virus. These results establish that the binding of 30-kDa CPSF to the NS1A protein is largely responsible for the posttranscriptional inhibition of the processing of these cellular antiviral pre-mRNAs. Mutation of this binding site in the NS1A protein also affects a second cellular antiviral response: in cells infected by the mutant virus, IFN-beta mRNA is produced earlier and in larger amounts.},

@article{Fortes1994,
abstract = {The influenza virus RNA segment 8 encodes two proteins, NS1 and NS2, by differential splicing. The collinear transcript acts as mRNA for NS1 protein, while the spliced mRNA encodes NS2 protein. The splicing of NS1 mRNA was studied in cells transfected with a recombinant plasmid that has the cDNA of RNA segment 8 cloned under the SV40 late promoter and polyadenylation signals. As described for influenza virus-infected cells, NS1 mRNA was poorly spliced to yield NS2 mRNA. However, inactivation of the NS1 gene, but not the NS2 gene, led to a substantial increase in the splicing efficiency, as shown by the relative accumulations of NS1 and NS2 mRNAs. This effect was not specific for NS1 mRNA, since the splicing of the endogenous SV40 early transcript was altered in such a way that t-Ag mRNA was almost eliminated. These changes in the splicing pattern coincided with a strong inhibition of the mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport. Both NS1 and NS2 mRNAs were retained in the nucleus of cells expressing NS1 protein, but no effect was observed when only NS2 protein was expressed. Furthermore, other mRNAs tested, such as T-Ag mRNA and the non-spliceable nucleoprotein transcript, were also retained in the nucleus upon expression of NS1 protein, suggesting that it induced a generalized block of mRNA export from the nucleus.},

abstract = {We have shown previously that the influenza virus NS1 protein inhibits the nuclear export of mRNAs. Here we demonstrate that the NS1 protein also regulates another post-transcriptional step: It inhibits pre-mRNA splicing both in vivo and in vitro. The mode by which the NS1 protein inhibits pre-mRNA splicing is novel. The pre-mRNA forms spliceosomes, but subsequent catalytic steps in splicing are inhibited. Affinity selection experiments establish that the NS1 protein is associated with the spliceosomes that are formed. The RNA-binding domain of the NS1 protein is required for the inhibition of splicing and for the interaction of the protein with spliceosomes. Because the NS1 protein is associated with U6 snRNA in influenza virus-infected cells as well as in splicing extracts from uninfected cells, it is likely that the NS1 protein also inhibits pre-mRNA splicing in infected cells. Surprisingly, the splicing of the viral ns1 mRNA, the very mRNA that encodes the NS1 protein, was resistant to inhibition by the NS1 protein. This resistance is conferred by sequences in ns1 mRNA.},

@article{Dankar2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The genetic basis for avian to mammalian host switching in influenza A virus is largely unknown. The human A/HK/156/1997 (H5N1) virus that transmitted from poultry possesses NS1 gene mutations F103L + M106I that are virulence determinants in the mouse model of pneumonia; however their individual roles have not been determined. The emergent A/Shanghai/patient1/2013(H7N9)-like viruses also possess these mutations which may contribute to their virulence and ability to switch species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: NS1 mutant viruses were constructed by reverse genetics and site directed mutagenesis on human and mouse-adapted backbones. Mouse infections assessed virulence, virus yield, tissue infection, and IFN induction. NS1 protein properties were assessed for subcellular distribution, IFN antagonism (mouse and human), CPSF30 and RIG-I domain binding, host transcription (microarray); and the natural prevalence of 103L and 106I mutants was assessed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Each of the F103L and M106I mutations contributes additively to virulence to reduce the lethal dose by >800 and >3,200 fold respectively by mediating alveolar tissue infection with >100 fold increased infectious yields. The 106I NS1 mutant lost CPSF binding but the 103L mutant maintained binding that correlated with an increased general decrease in host gene expression in human but not mouse cells. Each mutation positively modulated the inhibition of IFN induction in mouse cells and activation of the IFN-$\beta$ promoter in human cells but not in combination in human cells indicating negative epistasis. Each of the F103L and M106I mutations restored a defect in cytoplasmic localization of H5N1 NS1 in mouse cells. Human H1N1 and H3N2 NS1 proteins bound to the CARD, helicase and RD RIG-I domains, whereas the H5N1 NS1 with the same consensus 103F and 106M mutations did not bind these domains, which was totally or partially restored by the M106I or F103L mutations respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The F103L and M106I mutations in the H5N1 NS1 protein each increased IFN antagonism and mediated interstitial pneumonia in mice that was associated with increased cytoplasmic localization and altered host factor binding. These mutations may contribute to the ability of previous HPAI H5N1 and recent LPAI H7N9 and H6N1 (NS1-103L+106M) viruses to switch hosts and cause disease in humans.},

@article{Das2008,
abstract = {Influenza A viruses are responsible for seasonal epidemics and high mortality pandemics. A major function of the viral NS1A protein, a virulence factor, is the inhibition of the production of IFN-beta mRNA and other antiviral mRNAs. The NS1A protein of the human influenza A/Udorn/72 (Ud) virus inhibits the production of these antiviral mRNAs by binding the cellular 30-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30), which is required for the 3' end processing of all cellular pre-mRNAs. Here we report the 1.95-A resolution X-ray crystal structure of the complex formed between the second and third zinc finger domain (F2F3) of CPSF30 and the C-terminal domain of the Ud NS1A protein. The complex is a tetramer, in which each of two F2F3 molecules wraps around two NS1A effector domains that interact with each other head-to-head. This structure identifies a CPSF30 binding pocket on NS1A comprised of amino acid residues that are highly conserved among human influenza A viruses. Single amino acid changes within this binding pocket eliminate CPSF30 binding, and a recombinant Ud virus expressing an NS1A protein with such a substitution is attenuated and does not inhibit IFN-beta pre-mRNA processing. This binding pocket is a potential target for antiviral drug development. The crystal structure also reveals that two amino acids outside of this pocket, F103 and M106, which are highly conserved (>99\%) among influenza A viruses isolated from humans, participate in key hydrophobic interactions with F2F3 that stabilize the complex.},

@article{Qiu1995,
abstract = {The influenza virus NS1 protein is a unique posttranscriptional regulator that has two activities: inhibition of the nuclear export of poly A-containing mRNAs and inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing. Here we demonstrate that this protein binds to a specific region in one of the human spliceosomal snRNAs, U6 snRNA. Using U6 deletion mutations, we show that the binding of the NS1 protein requires both chains of a stem-bulge structure encompassing nucleotides 27-46 and nucleotides 83-101 of human U6 snRNA. A chemical modification/interference assay indicated that the primary binding site is centered around a purine-containing bulge in this stem-bulge structure. These results provide strong evidence that this postulated secondary structure in U6 snRNA actually exists. The NS1 protein also binds to a model U6-U4 snRNA complex, suggesting that the U6 stem-bulge comprising the NS1 protein binding site is also present in natural U6-U4 snRNA complexes. The U6 stem-bulge includes the U6 sequence that forms helix II with U2 snRNA during splicing, an interaction that is essential for mammalian splicing. We demonstrate that the NS1 protein blocks formation of the U6-U2 helix II both in a model system and during in vitro splicing. In addition, we show that the NS1 protein inhibits formation of U6-U4 snRNA complexes during in vitro splicing, presumably because the binding site of the NS1 protein includes the 3'-terminal region of U6 snRNA that has been shown to be important for the formation of U6-U4 complexes. We postulate that the inhibition of U6-U2 and U6-U4 snRNA complex formation is largely responsible for the inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing by the NS1 protein.},
