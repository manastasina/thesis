abstract = {Protein phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells and has a wide range of functional effects. Here, we used mass spectrometry to search for phosphorylated residues in all the proteins of influenza A and B viruses--to the best of our knowledge, the first time such a comprehensive approach has been applied to a virus. We identified 36 novel phosphorylation sites, as well as confirming 3 previously-identified sites. N-terminal processing and ubiquitination of viral proteins was also detected. Phosphorylation was detected in the polymerase proteins (PB2, PB1 and PA), glycoproteins (HA and NA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (M1), ion channel (M2), non-structural protein (NS1) and nuclear export protein (NEP). Many of the phosphorylation sites detected were conserved between influenza virus genera, indicating the fundamental importance of phosphorylation for all influenza viruses. Their structural context indicates roles for phosphorylation in regulating viral entry and exit (HA and NA); nuclear localisation (PB2, M1, NP, NS1 and, through NP and NEP, of the viral RNA genome); and protein multimerisation (NS1 dimers, M2 tetramers and NP oligomers). Using reverse genetics we show that for NP of influenza A viruses phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal NLS are important for viral growth, whereas mutating sites in the C-terminus has little or no effect. Mutating phosphorylation sites in the oligomerisation domains of NP inhibits viral growth and in some cases transcription and replication of the viral RNA genome. However, constitutive phosphorylation of these sites is not optimal. Taken together, the conservation, structural context and functional significance of phosphorylation sites implies a key role for phosphorylation in influenza biology. By identifying phosphorylation sites throughout the proteomes of influenza A and B viruses we provide a framework for further study of phosphorylation events in the viral life cycle and suggest a range of potential antiviral targets.},

abstract = {SUMOylation, the post-translational conjugation of the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) to a target protein, regulates a wide array of cellular processes and plays important roles for numerous viruses during infection. However, the relevance of the cellular SUMOylation system for influenza virus infection remains mostly unexplored. We previously reported that the non-structural protein of influenza A virus NS1 is a bona fide SUMO target. Here we determine that at least four additional influenza virus proteins, namely PB1, NP, M1, and NS2, are also authentic SUMO targets, and provide data supporting that PB1, NP, and M1 are SUMOylated during viral infection. The functional relevance of SUMOylation for these proteins is supported by the observation that, despite no apparent changes in the cellular levels of the E1 and E2 SUMO enzymes, influenza viral infection leads to a global increase in cellular SUMOylation. This increase, characterized by the appearance of two new SUMOylated proteins of ∼70. kDa and ∼52. kDa of molecular weight, is dependent upon viral replication and cannot be recreated by interferon stimulation alone. Altogether, these observations indicate that influenza A virus interacts extensively with the cellular SUMOylation system during infection and suggest that SUMOylation plays an important role during influenza virus infection, potentially contributing to the functional diversity exhibited by influenza viral proteins. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Examination of the RNA patterns of the two parent viruses and recombinants derived from them in concert with serological identification of surface proteins and analysis of the other proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate gradient gels permitted the identification of the genes coding for hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and the P1, P2, and P3 proteins (Palese and Schulman, 1976; P. Palese et al., Virology, in press). In the present report we have extended these observations using similar techniques to examine other recombinants and have identified the genes coding for the remaining virus-specific moving RNA segment as 1) and segment 6 of Hong Kong virus coding for the respective nucleoproteins, and that segment 7 of both viruses codes for the membtane protein and RNA segment 8 codes for the nonstructural protein.

abstract = {To perform a genetic analysis of the influenza A virus NS1 gene, a library of NS1 mutants was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. A collection of mutant ribonucleic proteins containing the nonstructural genes was generated from the library that were rescued for an infectious virus mutant library by a novel RNP competition virus rescue procedure. Several temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant viruses were obtained by screening of the mutant library, and the sequences of their NS1 genes were determined. Most of the mutations identified led to amino acid exchanges and concentrated in the N-terminal region of the protein, but some of them occurred in the C-terminal region. Mutant 11C contained three mutations that led to amino acid exchanges, V18A, R44K, and S195P, all of which were required for the ts phenotype, and was characterized further. Several steps in the infection were slightly altered: (i) M1, M2, NS1, and neuraminidase (NA) accumulations were reduced and (ii) NS1 protein was retained in the nucleus in a temperature-independent manner, but these modifications could not justify the strong virus titer reduction at restrictive temperature. The most dramatic phenotype was the almost complete absence of virus particles in the culture medium, in spite of normal accumulation and nucleocytoplasmic export of virus RNPs. The function affected in the 11C mutant was required late in the infection, as documented by shift-up and shift-down experiments. The defect in virion production was not due to reduced NA expression, as virus yield could not be rescued by exogenous neuraminidase treatment. All together, the analysis of 11C mutant phenotype may indicate a role for NS1 protein in a late event in virus morphogenesis.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus non-structural protein NS1 was produced using a copper-inducible expression system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The protein produced had a molecular weight of 26 kDa by SDS-PAGE and was reactive with anti-NS1 antisera. The recombinant NS1 protein was targetted to the nucleolus/nuclear envelope fraction of the yeast cell nucleus, showing that its localisation signals remain functional in yeast. In addition, immune-electron microscopy detected cytoplasmic inclusions reminiscent of those seen in cells infected with some influenza strains. The NS1 protein was shown to be capable of in vivo self-interaction which probably forms the basis of its propensity to form inclusions. Expression of the protein was found to be toxic to yeast cells expressing it, supporting a role for the protein in the shutdown of influenza virus-infected cells. Deletion mapping of NS1 pointed to 2 regions of the molecule being important for this toxicity: a basic C-terminal stretch which has been shown to act as a nuclear localisation signal, and an N-terminal region implicated in RNA binding.},

abstract = {The type-specific non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A viruses was found to be heterogeneous with respect to charge, varying in pI by more than two orders of magnitude, and to phosphorylation. Phosphorylation was strain-specific, variable in extent between strains, and in some strains NS1 proteins were not detectably phosphorylated. Phosphorylation was not responsible for the major variations in charge as, paradoxically, the most acidic NS1 proteins were not phosphorylated. Cytoplasmic inclusions, which are formed between NS1 proteins and cellular RNA in infections with a number of human strains, were absent from A/FP/Rostock-infected cells and do not, therefore, appear to be essential in virus multiplication. We suggest that the acidic nature of the NS1 of A/FP/Rostock may prevent it from binding RNA and hence from forming inclusions. The variation in charge of NS1 proteins which we determined experimentally correlates with the overall differences in charge adduced from published amino acid sequence and implications of this variability to the biological role of NS1 are discussed.},

abstract = {We established a reverse genetics system for the nonstructural (NS) gene segment of influenza A virus. This system is based on the use of the temperature-sensitive (ts) reassortant virus 25A-1. The 25A-1 virus contains the NS gene from influenza A/Leningrad/134/57 virus and the remaining gene segments from A/Puerto Rico (PR)/8/34 virus. This particular gene constellation was found to be responsible for the ts phenotype. For reverse genetics of the NS gene, a plasmid-derived NS gene from influenza A/PR/8/34 virus was ribonucleoprotein transfected into cells that were previously infected with the 25A-1 virus. Two subsequent passages of the transfection supernatant at 40 degreesC selected viruses containing the transfected NS gene derived from A/PR/8/34 virus. The high efficiency of the selection process permitted the rescue of transfectant viruses with large deletions of the C-terminal part of the NS1 protein. Viable transfectant viruses containing the N-terminal 124, 80, or 38 amino acids of the NS1 protein were obtained. Whereas all deletion mutants grew to high titers in Vero cells, growth on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and replication in mice decreased with increasing length of the deletions. In Vero cells expression levels of viral proteins of the deletion mutants were similar to those of the wild type. In contrast, in MDCK cells the level of the M1 protein was significantly reduced for the deletion mutants.},

abstract = {Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) family proteins function by becoming covalently attached to other proteins as post-translational modifications. SUMO modifies many proteins that participate in diverse cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, nuclear transport, maintenance of genome integrity, and signal transduction. Reversible attachment of SUMO is controlled by an enzyme pathway that is analogous to the ubiquitin pathway. The functional consequences of SUMO attachment vary greatly from substrate to substrate, and in many cases are not understood at the molecular level. Frequently SUMO alters interactions of substrates with other proteins or with DNA, but SUMO can also act by blocking ubiquitin attachment sites. An unusual feature of SUMO modification is that, for most substrates, only a small fraction of the substrate is sumoylated at any given time. This review discusses our current understanding of how SUMO conjugation is controlled, as well as the roles of SUMO in a number of biological processes.},

abstract = {Real-time fluorescence imaging of viral proteins in living cells provides a valuable means to study virus-host interactions. The challenge of generating replication-competent fluorescent influenza A virus is that the segmented genome does not allow fusion of a fluorescent protein gene to any viral gene. Here, we introduced the tetracysteine (TC) biarsenical labeling system into influenza virus in order to fluorescently label viral protein in the virus life cycle. We generated infectious influenza A viruses bearing a small TC tag (CCPGCC) in the loop/linker regions of the NS1 proteins. In the background of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) virus, the TC tag can be inserted into NS1 after amino acid 52 (AA52) (PR8-410), AA79 (PR8-412), or AA102 (PR8-413) or the TC tag can be inserted and replace amino acids 79 to 84 (AA79-84) (PR8-411). Although PR8-410, PR8-411, and PR8-412 viruses are attenuated than the wild-type (WT) virus to some extent in multiple-cycle infection, their growth potential is similar to that of the WT virus during a single cycle of infection, and their NS1 subcellular localization and viral protein synthesis rate are quite similar to those of the WT virus. Furthermore, labeling with membrane-permeable biarsenical dye resulted in fluorescent NS1 protein in the context of virus infection. We could exploit this strategy on NS1 protein of A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) (Tx91) by successfully rescuing a TC-tagged virus, Tx91-445, which carries the TC tag replacement of AA79-84. The infectivity of Tx91-445 virus was similar to that of WT Tx91 during multiple cycles of replication and a single cycle of replication. The NS1 protein derived from Tx91-445 can be fluorescently labeled in living cells. Finally, with biarsenical labeling, the engineered replication-competent virus allowed us to visualize NS1 protein nuclear import in virus-infected cells in real time.},

abstract = {Influenza virus unspliced NS1 mRNA, like retroviral pre-mRNAs, is efficiently exported from the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm of infected cells. With human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the transport of viral pre-mRNAs is facilitated by the viral Rev protein. We tested the possibility that the influenza virus NS1 protein, a nuclear protein that is encoded by unspliced NS1 mRNA, has the same function as the HIV Rev protein. Surprisingly, using transient transfection assays, we found that rather than facilitating the nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced NS1 mRNA, the NS1 protein inhibited the transport of NS2 mRNA, the spliced mRNA generated from NS1 mRNA. The efficient transport of NS2 mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm occurred only when the synthesis of the NS1 protein was abrogated by amber mutations. The NS1 protein down-regulated the export of NS2 mRNA whether or not it was generated by splicing, indicating that the NS1 protein acted directly on transport. Actinomycin D chase experiments verified that the NS1 protein acted on the transport and not on the differential stability of NS2 mRNA in the nucleus as compared to the cytoplasm. In addition, the NS1 protein inhibited the transport of NS1 mRNA itself, which contains all of the sequences in NS2 mRNA, particularly when NS1 mRNA was released from the splicing machinery by mutating its 3'-splice site. Our results indicate that the NS1 protein-mediated inhibition of transport requires sequences in NS2 mRNA. The transport of the viral PB1 protein, nucleocapsid protein, hemagglutinin, membrane protein, and M2 mRNAs was not affected by the NS1 protein. When the NS2 mRNA sequence was covalently attached to the PB1 mRNA, the transport of the chimeric mRNA was inhibited by the NS1 protein. Our results identify a novel function of the influenza virus NS1 protein and demonstrate that post-transcriptional control of gene expression can also occur at the level of the nucleocytoplasmic transport of a mature, spliced mRNA.},

abstract = {Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15, which is robustly induced by IFN or virus, is implicated to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) in vivo. But the underlying mechanism still remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that Herc5 could catalyze conjugation of ISG15 onto IAV-NS1 protein, the critical virulence factor of IAV. This modification produces two more species, respectively mapped to IAV-NS1 at lysine 20, 41, 217, 219, and 108, 110, and 126. The ISGylated IAV-NS1 fails to form homodimers and inhibits relevant antiviral processes. Knockdown of Herc5 or ISG15 could partially alleviate IFN-beta-induced antiviral activities against IAV, whereas ectopic expression of the Herc5-mediated ISGylation system could distinctly potentiate IFN-beta-induced antiviral effects against IAV. Notably, IAV-NS1s of H5N1 avian IAVs display less ISGylation species than that of IAV-PR8/34 (human H1N1). Consistently, IAV-PR8/34 mutants deprived of IAV-NS1's ISGylation exhibit augmented viral propagation and virulence in both cultured cells and mice. Our study reports the first microbial target of ISGylation and uncovers the direct antiviral function and mechanism of this novel modification.},

abstract = {The non-structural protein 1 of influenza virus (NS1) is a relatively small polypeptide with an outstanding number of ascribed functions. NS1 is the main viral antagonist of the innate immune response during influenza virus infection, chiefly by inhibiting the type I interferon system at multiple steps. As such, its role is critical to overcome the first barrier the host presents to halt the viral infection. However, the pro-viral activities of this well-studied protein go far beyond and include regulation of viral RNA and protein synthesis, and disruption of the host cell homeostasis by dramatically affecting general gene expression while tweaking the PI3K signaling network. Because of all of this, NS1 is a key virulence factor that impacts influenza pathogenesis, and adaptation to new hosts, making it an attractive target for control strategies. Here, we will overview the many roles that have been ascribed to the NS1 protein, and give insights into the sequence features and structural properties that make them possible, highlighting the need to understand how NS1 can actually perform all of these functions during viral infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the important role of the non-structural 1 (NS) gene of influenza A in virulence of the virus is well established, our knowledge about the extent of variation in the NS gene pool of influenza A viruses in their natural reservoirs in Europe is incomplete. In this study we determined the subtypes and prevalence of influenza A viruses present in mallards in Northern Europe and further analysed the NS gene of these isolates in order to obtain a more detailed knowledge about the genetic variation of NS gene of influenza A virus in their natural hosts. RESULTS: A total number of 45 influenza A viruses of different subtypes were studied. Eleven haemagglutinin- and nine neuraminidase subtypes in twelve combinations were found among the isolated viruses. Each NS gene reported here consisted of 890 nucleotides; there were no deletions or insertions. Phylogenetic analysis clearly shows that two distinct gene pools, corresponding to both NS allele A and B, were present at the same time in the same geographic location in the mallard populations in Northern Europe. A comparison of nucleotide sequences of isolated viruses revealed a substantial number of silent mutations, which results in high degree of homology in amino acid sequences. The degree of variation within the alleles is very low. In our study allele A viruses displays a maximum of 5\% amino acid divergence while allele B viruses display only 2\% amino acid divergence. All the viruses isolated from mallards in Northern Europe possessed the typical avian ESEV amino acid sequence at the C-terminal end of the NS1 protein. CONCLUSION: Our finding indicates the existence of a large reservoir of different influenza A viruses in mallards population in Northern Europe. Although our phylogenetic analysis clearly shows that two distinct gene pools, corresponding to both NS allele A and B, were present in the mallards populations in Northern Europe, allele B viruses appear to be less common in natural host species than allele A, comprising only about 13\% of the isolates sequenced in this study. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a virulence factor, which is targeted into the cell cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus. NS1 is a multi-functional protein that inhibits host cell pre-mRNA processing and counteracts host cell antiviral responses. Previously, we have shown that the NS1 protein of the H3N2 subtype influenza viruses possesses a C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) that also functions as a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) and targets the protein into the nucleolus. RESULTS: Here, we show that the NS1 protein of the human H3N2 virus subtype interacts in vitro primarily via its C-terminal NLS2/NoLS and to a minor extent via its N-terminal NLS1 with the nucleolar proteins, nucleolin and fibrillarin. Using chimeric green fluorescence protein (GFP)-NS1 fusion constructs, we show that the nucleolar retention of the NS1 protein is determined by its C-terminal NLS2/NoLS in vivo. Confocal laser microscopy analysis shows that the NS1 protein colocalizes with nucleolin in nucleoplasm and nucleolus and with B23 and fibrillarin in the nucleolus of influenza A/Udorn/72 virus-infected A549 cells. Since some viral proteins contain NoLSs, it is likely that viruses have evolved specific nucleolar functions. CONCLUSION: NS1 protein of the human H3N2 virus interacts primarily via the C-terminal NLS2/NoLS and to a minor extent via the N-terminal NLS1 with the main nucleolar proteins, nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin.},

abstract = {ISG15 is an IFN-alpha/beta-induced, ubiquitin-like protein that is conjugated to a wide array of cellular proteins through the sequential action of three conjugation enzymes that are also induced by IFN-alpha/beta. Recent studies showed that ISG15 and/or its conjugates play an important role in protecting cells from infection by several viruses, including influenza A virus. However, the mechanism by which ISG15 modification exerts antiviral activity has not been established. Here we extend the repertoire of ISG15 targets to a viral protein by demonstrating that the NS1 protein of influenza A virus (NS1A protein), an essential, multifunctional protein, is ISG15 modified in virus-infected cells. We demonstrate that the major ISG15 acceptor site in the NS1A protein in infected cells is a critical lysine residue (K41) in the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD). ISG15 modification of K41 disrupts the association of the NS1A RBD domain with importin-alpha, the protein that mediates nuclear import of the NS1A protein, whereas the RBD retains its double-stranded RNA-binding activity. Most significantly, we show that ISG15 modification of K41 inhibits influenza A virus replication and thus contributes to the antiviral action of IFN-beta. We also show that the NS1A protein directly and specifically binds to Herc5, the major E3 ligase for ISG15 conjugation in human cells. These results establish a "loss of function" mechanism for the antiviral activity of the IFN-induced ISG15 conjugation system, namely, that it inhibits viral replication by conjugating ISG15 to a specific viral protein, thereby inhibiting its function.},

abstract = {In 2009, a novel swine-origin H1N1 influenza A virus emerged. Here, we characterize the multifunctional NS1 protein of this human pandemic virus in order to understand factors that may contribute to replication efficiency or pathogenicity. Although the 2009 H1N1 virus NS1 protein (2009/NS1) is an effective interferon antagonist, we found that this NS1 (unlike those of previous human-adapted influenza A viruses) is unable to block general host gene expression in human or swine cells. This property could be restored in 2009/NS1 by replacing R108, E125, and G189 with residues corresponding to human virus consensus. Mechanistically, these previously undescribed mutations acted by increasing binding of 2009/NS1 to the cellular pre-mRNA processing protein CPSF30. A recombinant 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (A/California/04/09) expressing NS1 with these gain-of-function substitutions was more efficient than the wild type at antagonizing host innate immune responses in primary human epithelial cells. However, such mutations had no significant effect on virus replication in either human or swine tissue culture substrates. Surprisingly, in a mouse model of pathogenicity, the mutant virus appeared to cause less morbidity, and was cleared faster, than the wild type. The mutant virus also demonstrated reduced titers in the upper respiratory tracts of ferrets; however, contact and aerosol transmissibility of the virus was unaffected. Our data highlight a potential human adaptation of NS1 that seems absent in "classically derived" swine-origin influenza A viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 virus. We discuss the impact that a natural future gain of this NS1 function may have on the new pandemic virus in humans.},

abstract = {RNA segment 8 of the influenza virus genome is unique in coding for two polypeptides, NS1 (Mr, approximately 25,000) and NS2 (Mr, approximately 11,000). These polypeptides are synthesized from separate mRNA species. By using cloned DNA derived from RNA segment 8 (NS DNA) the two mRNAs have been mapped on segment 8 by hybridization of mRNAs with restriction endonuclease fragments of the DNA and nuclease S1 digestion methods. These data indicate that the body of the NS1 mRNA (approximately 850 nucleotides) maps at 0.05-0.95 units of the cloned NS DNA and the body of the NS2 mRNA (approximately 340 nucleotides) maps at 0.59-0.95 unitssuggesting that the two mRNAs are 3' coterminal and share the same poly(A) addition site. These positions of the mRNAs on the viral genome segment were confirmed in hybrid-arrested translation experiments using fragments of the cloned NS DNA to inhibit the synthesis in vitro of NS1 or NS2 polypeptides. In addition, in these translation experiments the use of certain DNA fragments resulted in premature termination of the NS1 polypeptide. From these data, it could be estimated that the termination of translation of NS1 is at approximately 0.76 map unit. Thus, the coding regions of the two mRNAs overlap by approximately 144-159 nucleotides, the equivalent of approximately 48-53 amino acids. Peptide mapping experiments indicated that polypeptides NS1 and NS2 do not share methionine- or leucine-containing tryptic peptides. The results obtained indicate the translation of the NS2 mRNA occurs in a reading frame different from that used for NS1.},

It counteracts the interferon response, and also exhibits other activities towards viral and cellular RNAs. NS1 is known to bind non-specifically to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as well as to viral and cellular RNAs. We set out to search whether NS1 could preferentially bind sequence-specific RNA patterns, and performed an in vitro selection (SELEX) to isolate NS1-specific aptamers from a pool of 80-nucleotide(nt)-long RNAs. Among the 63 aptamers characterized, two families were found to harbour a sequence that is strictly conserved at the 5' terminus of all positive-strand RNAs of influenzaviruses A. We found a second virus-specific motif, a 9 nucleotide sequence located 15 nucleotides downstream from NS1's stop codon. In addition, a majority of aptamers had one or two symmetrically positioned copies of the 5'-GUAAC / 3'-CUUAG double-stranded motif, which closely resembles the canonical 5'-splice site. Through an in-depth analysis of the interaction combining fluorimetry and gel-shift assays, we showed that NS1's RNA-binding domain (RBD) specifically recognizes sequence patterns in a structure-dependent manner, resulting in an intimate interaction with high affinity (low nanomolar to subnanomolar K(D) values) that leads to oligomerization of the RBD on its RNA ligands.},

Furthermore, two lysine residues in the C terminus of NS1 were identified as SUMO1 acceptor sites. When the SUMO1 acceptor sites were removed by mutation, NS1 underwent rapid degradation. Studies of different influenza A virus strains of human and avian origin showed that the majority of viruses possess an NS1 protein that is modified by SUMO1, except for the recently emerged swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV) (H1N1). Interestingly, growth of a sumoylation-deficient WSN virus mutant was retarded compared to that of wild-type virus. Together, these results indicate that sumoylation enhances NS1 stability and thus promotes rapid growth of influenza A virus.},

abstract = {NS1 of influenza A virus is a potent antagonist of host antiviral interferon responses. This multifunctional protein with two distinctive domains, an RNA-binding domain (RBD) and an effector domain (ED) separated by a linker region (LR), is implicated in replication, pathogenesis, and host range. Although the structures of individual domains of NS1 from different strains of influenza viruses have been reported, the only structure of full-length NS1 available to date is from an H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004). By carrying out crystallographic analyses of full-length H6N6-NS1 (A/blue-winged teal/MN/993/1980) and an LR deletion mutant, combined with mutational analysis, we show here that these full-length NS1 structures provide an exquisite structural sampling of various conformational states of NS1 that based on the orientation of the ED with respect to RBD can be summarized as "open," "semi-open," and "closed" conformations. Our studies show that preference for these states is clearly dictated by determinants such as linker length, residue composition at position 71, and a mechanical hinge, providing a structural basis for strain-dependent functional variations in NS1. Because of the flexibility inherent in the LR, any particular NS1 could sample the conformational space around these states to engage ED in different quaternary interactions so that it may participate in specific protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions to allow for the known multifunctionality of NS1. We propose that such conformational plasticity provides a mechanism for autoregulating NS1 functions, depending on its temporal distribution, posttranslational modifications, and nuclear or cellular localization, during the course of virus infection. IMPORTANCE: NS1 of influenza A virus is a multifunctional protein associated with numerous strain-specific regulatory functions during viral infection, including conferring resistance to antiviral interferon induction, replication, pathogenesis, virulence, and host range. NS1 has two domains, an RNA-binding domain and an effector domain separated by a linker. To date, the only full-length NS1 structure available is that from an H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004). Here, we determined crystal structures of the wild type and a linker region mutant of the H6N6 NS1 (A/blue-winged teal/MN/993/1980), which together with the previously determined H5N1 NS1 structure show that NS1 exhibits significant strain-dependent structural polymorphism due to variations in linker length, residue composition at position 71, and a mechanical hinge. Such a structural polymorphism may be the basis for strain-specific functions associated with NS1.},

However, in contrast to the virus inhibition results for mice, the rates of virus replication in ISG15(+/+) and ISG15(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts in tissue culture were similar. Here we focus on human tissue culture cells and on the effect of ISG15 and/or its conjugation on influenza A virus gene expression and replication in such cells. We demonstrate that IFN-induced antiviral activity against influenza A virus in human cells is significantly alleviated by inhibiting ISG15 conjugation using small interfering RNAs directed against ISG15-conjugating enzymes. IFN-induced antiviral activity against influenza A virus protein synthesis was reduced 5- to 20-fold by suppressing ISG15 conjugation. The amounts of the viral proteins that were restored by these siRNA treatments were approximately 40 to 50\% of the amounts produced in cells that were not pretreated with IFN. Further, we show that ISG15 conjugation inhibits influenza A virus replication 10- to 20-fold at early times after infection in human cells. These results show that ISG15 conjugation plays a substantial role in the antiviral state induced by IFN in human cells. In contrast, we show that in mouse embryo fibroblasts ISG15 conjugation not only does not affect influenza A virus replication but also does not contribute to the IFN-induced antiviral activity against influenza A virus gene expression.},

However, it is clear that NS1 also acts directly to modulate other important aspects of the virus replication cycle, including viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and general host-cell physiology. Here, we review the current literature on this remarkably multifunctional viral protein. In the first part of this article, we summarize the basic biochemistry of NS1, in particular its synthesis, structure, and intracellular localization. We then discuss the various roles NS1 has in regulating viral replication mechanisms, host innate/adaptive immune responses, and cellular signalling pathways. We focus on the NS1-RNA and NS1-protein interactions that are fundamental to these processes, and highlight apparent strain-specific ways in which different NS1 proteins may act. In this regard, the contributions of certain NS1 functions to the pathogenicity of human and animal influenza A viruses are also discussed. Finally, we outline practical applications that future studies on NS1 may lead to, including the rational design and manufacture of influenza vaccines, the development of novel antiviral drugs, and the use of oncolytic influenza A viruses as potential anti-cancer agents.},

The selected aptamer binds to NS1 with a Kd of 18.91 ± 3.95 nM and RNA binding domain of NS1 is determined to be critical for the aptamer binding. The aptamer has a G-rich sequence in the random sequence region and forms a G-quadruplex structure. The localization of the aptamer bound to NS1 in cells was determined by confocal images, and flow cytometry analysis further demonstrated that the selected aptamer binds specifically to NS1. In addition, luciferase reporter gene assay, quantitative RT-PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments demonstrated that the selected aptamer had the ability to induce IFN-$\beta$ by suppressing the function of NS1. Importantly, we also found that the selected aptamer was able to inhibit the viral replication without affecting cell viability.

abstract = {We demonstrate that phosphorylation of the NS1 protein of a human influenza A virus occurs not only at the threonine (T) at position 215 but also at serines (Ss), specifically at positions 42 and 48. By generating recombinant influenza A/Udorn/72 (Ud) viruses that encode mutant NS1 proteins, we determined the roles of these phosphorylations in virus replication. At position 215 only a T-to-A substitution attenuated replication, whereas other substitutions (T to E to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, T to N, and T to P, the amino acid in avian influenza A virus NS1 proteins) had no effect. We conclude that attenuation resulting from the T-to-A substitution at position 215 is attributable to a deleterious structural change in the NS1 protein that is not caused by other amino acid substitutions and that phosphorylation of T215 does not affect virus replication. At position 48 neither an S-to-A substitution nor an S-to-D substitution that mimics constitutive phosphorylation affected virus replication. In contrast, at position 42, an S-to-D, but not an S-to-A, substitution caused attenuation. The S-to-D substitution eliminates detectable double-stranded RNA binding by the NS1 protein, accounting for attenuation of virus replication. We show that protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha) catalyzes S42 phosphorylation. Consequently, the only phosphorylation of the NS1 protein of this human influenza A virus that regulates its replication is S42 phosphorylation catalyzed by PKCalpha. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ts or Ss in the NS1 protein of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus was not detected, indicating that NS1 phosphorylation probably does not play any role in the replication of this virus.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1A protein) is a virulence factor which is targeted into the nucleus. It is a multifunctional protein that inhibits host cell pre-mRNA processing and counteracts host cell antiviral responses. We show that the NS1A protein can interact with all six human importin alpha isoforms, indicating that the nuclear translocation of NS1A protein is mediated by the classical importin alpha/beta pathway. The NS1A protein of the H1N1 (WSN/33) virus has only one N-terminal arginine- or lysine-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS1), whereas the NS1A protein of the H3N2 subtype (Udorn/72) virus also has a second C-terminal NLS (NLS2). NLS1 is mapped to residues 35 to 41, which also function in the double-stranded RNA-binding activity of the NS1A protein. NLS2 was created by a 7-amino-acid C-terminal extension (residues 231 to 237) that became prevalent among human influenza A virus types isolated between the years 1950 to 1987. NLS2 includes basic amino acids at positions 219, 220, 224, 229, 231, and 232. Surprisingly, NLS2 also forms a functional nucleolar localization signal NoLS, a function that was retained in H3N2 type virus NS1A proteins even without the C-terminal extension. It is likely that the evolutionarily well-conserved nucleolar targeting function of NS1A protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of influenza A virus.},

abstract = {Previously we found that the amino-terminal region of the NS1 protein of influenza A virus plays a key role in preventing the induction of beta interferon (IFN-beta) in virus-infected cells. This region is characterized by its ability to bind to different RNA species, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a known potent inducer of IFNs. In order to investigate whether the NS1 RNA-binding activity is required for its IFN antagonist properties, we have generated a recombinant influenza A virus which expresses a mutant NS1 protein defective in dsRNA binding. For this purpose, we substituted alanines for two basic amino acids within NS1 (R38 and K41) that were previously found to be required for RNA binding. Cells infected with the resulting recombinant virus showed increased IFN-beta production, demonstrating that these two amino acids play a critical role in the inhibition of IFN production by the NS1 protein during viral infection. In addition, this virus grew to lower titers than wild-type virus in MDCK cells, and it was attenuated in mice. Interestingly, passaging in MDCK cells resulted in the selection of a mutant virus containing a third mutation at amino acid residue 42 of the NS1 protein (S42G). This mutation did not result in a gain in dsRNA-binding activity by the NS1 protein, as measured by an in vitro assay. Nevertheless, the NS1 R38AK41AS42G mutant virus was able to replicate in MDCK cells to titers close to those of wild-type virus. This mutant virus had intermediate virulence in mice, between those of the wild-type and parental NS1 R38AK41A viruses. These results suggest not only that the IFN antagonist properties of the NS1 protein depend on its ability to bind dsRNA but also that they can be modulated by amino acid residues not involved in RNA binding.},

abstract = {In previous studies we showed that a ninth polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 11,000 (NS2) found in influenza virus-infected cells was unique, that it could be synthesized in vitro, and that its expression in vivo required early protein synthesis. On the basis of these results we suggested that one of the eight genome RNA segments of influenza virus codes for two polypeptides [Lamb, R.A., Etkind, P.R. \& Choppin, P.W. (1978) Virology 91, 60-78]. We describe here differences in the electrophoretic mobility of the NS2 polypeptides of different strains of influenza A virus. These results provided further evidence that NS2 is virus coded and also made possible genetic studies using recombinants between two virus strains (HK and PR8) whose NS2 polypeptides differ. These studies showed that the gene for NS2 reassorts with that of the nonstructural polypeptide NS1, which is coded by genome segment 8. A mRNA for NS2 has been separated from that of NS1 and the other viral polypeptides by centrifugation and has been translated in vitro. Hybridization of genome segment 8 to the total mRNAs from infected cells specifically prevented the synthesis of NS2 and NS1. These results indicate that influenza virus genome segment 8 is transcribed into two separate mRNAs that code for two polypeptides, NS1 and NS2. Possible mechanisms for the transcription of the two mRNAs from either contiguous or overlapping genes are discussed.},

abstract = {The synthesis and phosphorylation of influenza virus nucleoprotein and nonstructural protein were analyzed. The nucleoprotein (NP) was found to be phosphorylated in both infected cells and in isolated virions. The phosphate is in a monoester linkage to a serine residue. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of the 32P-labeled protein, as well as measurements of specific activity, suggests that NP is phosphorylated at one site per molecule. The viral nonstructural (NS 1) protein is also phosphorylated, but on threonine residues. Up to a maximum of two sites per NS 1 molecule could be so modified in infected cells, as demonstrated by two different methods of tryptic peptide analysis and by measurements of the ratio of 32P to 3H-amino-acids incorporated into NS 1 protein species. The NS 1 protein is resolved into four major species of differing isoelectric point in a two-dimensional electrophoretogram. The most acidic species was found to have two phosphorylated sites per molecule, and the next most acidic species contained on the average one phosphate per molecule. Treatment of the phosphorylated species with bacterial alkaline phosphatase demonstrated that the level of phosphorylation is the only identifiable difference between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated NS 1 species. The distinction between the two unphosphorylated species could not be determined. The distribution of the un-, mono-, and diphosphorylated NS 1 species was characterized at different times after synthesis. These modifications were found to occur very rapidly after translation (30 to 60 s), after transport of the unmodified species from cytoplasm to nucleus of the infected cell. The phosphorylation of NP also takes place rapidly after its synthesis; the site within the cell of the NP phosphorylation has not been unambiguously determined.},

abstract = {Our pioneering studies on the interplay between the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) and influenza A virus identified the nonstructural protein NS1 as the first known SUMO target of influenza virus and one of the most abundantly SUMOylated influenza virus proteins. Here, we further characterize the role of SUMOylation for the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) NS1 protein, demonstrating that NS1 is SUMOylated not only by SUMO1 but also by SUMO2/3 and mapping the main SUMOylation sites in NS1 to residues K219 and K70. Furthermore, by using SUMOylatable and non-SUMOylatable forms of NS1 and an NS1-specific artificial SUMO ligase (ASL) that increases NS1 SUMOylation \~{}4-fold, we demonstrate that SUMOylation does not affect the stability or cellular localization of PR8 NS1. However, NS1's ability to be SUMOylated appears to affect virus multiplication, as indicated by the delayed growth of a virus expressing the non-SUMOylatable form of NS1 in the interferon (IFN)-competent MDCK cell line. Remarkably, while a non-SUMOylatable form of NS1 exhibited a substantially diminished ability to neutralize IFN production, increasing NS1 SUMOylation beyond its normal levels also exerted a negative effect on its IFN-blocking function. This observation indicates the existence of an optimal level of NS1 SUMOylation that allows NS1 to achieve maximal activity and suggests that the limited amount of SUMOylation normally observed for most SUMO targets may correspond to an optimal level that maximizes the contribution of SUMOylation to protein function. Finally, protein cross-linking data suggest that SUMOylation may affect NS1 function by regulating the abundance of NS1 dimers and trimers in the cell.},

As discussed in this Review, these effector pathways individually block viral transcription, degrade viral RNA, inhibit translation and modify protein function to control all steps of viral replication.

abstract = {Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A virus plays a central role in virus replication and blockade of the host innate immune response, and is therefore being considered as a potential therapeutic target. The primary function of NS1 is to dampen the host interferon (IFN) response through several distinct molecular mechanisms that are triggered by interactions with dsRNA or specific cellular proteins. Sequestration of dsRNA by NS1 results in inhibition of the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase/RNase L antiviral pathway, and also inhibition of dsRNA-dependent signaling required for new IFN production. Binding of NS1 to the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 prevents activation of RIG-I signaling and subsequent IFN induction. Cellular RNA processing is also targeted by NS1, through recognition of cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30 (CPSF30), leading to inhibition of IFN-?? mRNA processing as well as that of other cellular mRNAs. In addition NS1 binds to and inhibits cellular protein kinase R (PKR), thus blocking an important arm of the IFN system. Many additional proteins have been reported to interact with NS1, either directly or indirectly, which may serve its anti-IFN and additional functions, including the regulation of viral and host gene expression, signaling pathways and viral pathogenesis. Many of these interactions are potential targets for small-molecule intervention. Structural, biochemical and functional studies have resulted in hypotheses for drug discovery approaches that are beginning to bear experimental fruit, such as targeting the dsRNA-NS1 interaction, which could lead to restoration of innate immune function and inhibition of virus replication. This review describes biochemical, cell-based and nucleic acid-based approaches to identifying NS1 antagonists. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

One of our major goals is to determine how the NS1 protein recognizes and binds to its several RNA targets. As the first step for conducting structural studies, we have succeeded in identifying a fragment of the NS1 protein that possesses all the RNA-binding activities of the full-length protein. The RNA-binding fragment consists of the 73 amino-terminal amino acids of the protein. We have developed procedures for obtaining large amounts of the polypeptide in pure form. This has enabled us to establish the RNA-binding properties of this polypeptide and to demonstrate that it retains the ability to dimerize exhibited by the full-length protein. In addition, far-UV CD spectroscopy indicates that this RNA-binding polypeptide is largely (approximately 80\%) helical, suggesting that the mode of dimerization of the NS1 protein and of its interaction with RNA is mediated, at least in part, by helices.},

Their replication and transcription take place in the nucleus of infected cells using ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) as templates. Two of the viral transcripts, those generated by RNPs 7 and 8, can be spliced and lead to two alternative protein products (M1 and M2, NS1 and NEP/NS2, respectively). Previous studies have shown that when expressed from cDNA, NS1 protein alters the splicing and transport of RNA polymerase II-driven transcripts. Here we used a transient replication/transcription system, in which RNP 8 is replicated and transcribed by recombinant RNA and proteins, to study the splicing and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of true viral transcripts. Our results show that the encoded NS1 protein inhibits the splicing of the collinear transcript. This regulation is mediated by the N-terminal region of the protein but does not involve its RNA-binding activity. We also show that NS1 protein preferentially blocks the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of the collinear RNP 8 transcript in an RNA-binding dependent manner. These results rule out previous models to explain the regulation of mRNA processing and transport by NS1 and underlines the relevance of NS1 protein in the control of virus gene expression.},

abstract = {In the cell nucleus the NS1 protein of influenza A virus inhibits both pre-mRNA splicing and the nuclear export of mRNAs. Both the RNA-binding and effector domains of the protein are required for these nuclear functions. Here we demonstrate that the NS1 protein has a latent nuclear export signal (NES) that is located at the amino end of the effector domain. In uninfected, transfected cells the NS1 protein is localized in the nucleus because the NES is specifically inhibited by the adjacent amino acid sequence in the effector domain. Substitution of alanine residues for specific amino acids in the adjacent sequence abrogates its inhibitory activity, thereby unmasking the NES and causing the full-length NS1 protein to be localized to the cytoplasm. In contrast to uninfected cells, a substantial amount of the NS1 protein in influenza virus-infected cells is located in the cytoplasm. Consequently, the NES of these NS1 protein molecules is unmasked in infected cells, indicating that the NS1 protein most likely carries out functions in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus. A dramatically different localization of the NS1 protein occurs in cells that are infected by a virus encoding an NS1 protein lacking the NES: the shortened NS1 protein molecules are almost totally in the nucleus. Because the NES of the full-length NS1 protein is unmasked in infected but not uninfected cells, it is likely that this unmasking results from a specific interaction of another virus-specific protein with the NS1 protein.},

abstract = {The cellular SUMOylation system affects the function of numerous viral proteins. Hence, the identification of novel viral targets for the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) is key to our understanding of virus-host interactions. The data obtained in this study demonstrate that the non-structural influenza A viral protein NS1A is an authentic SUMO target through the use of a dicistronic expression plasmid containing SUMO (the modifier) and Ubc9 (the SUMO-conjugating enzyme) separated by an Internal Ribosomal Entry Site (IRES). This dual expression plasmid produces a robust increase in cellular SUMOylation, therefore facilitating the characterization of cellular and viral SUMO targets. The identification of NS1A as a bona fide SUMO target suggests, for the first time, a role for SUMOylation during influenza virus infection. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lazarowitz1971,
abstract = {The virus-specific proteins in three types of cultured cells infected with the WSN strain of influenza virus have been analyzed. The seven structural proteins of the WSN virion were identified in infected cells, and in addition a nonstructural protein, designated NNP, was found in large amount in the nucleus of the infected cell. This nonstructural protein has an estimated molecular weight of 25,000 and is slightly smaller than protein 7, the smallest viral structural protein. Proteins NNP and 7 were isolated on an agarose column and shown to be distinct by peptide mapping. The seven viral structural proteins have been found in association with the plasma membrane of infected cells. Glycoproteins 5 and 6 are the last proteins to appear at the plasma membrane. The available evidence suggests that protein 2, which is found in much larger amount in infected cells than in the mature virion, is cleaved at the plasma membrane to yield proteins 5 and 6.},
