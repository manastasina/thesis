abstract = {Members of the Picornaviridae family are non-enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a 30. nm icosahedral capsid. This virus family exhibits a considerable amount of genetic variability driven both by mutation and recombination. Recently, three previously unknown human picornaviruses, namely the human Saffold cardiovirus, cosavirus and salivirus, have been identified in stools or respiratory samples from subjects presenting symptoms ranging from gastroenteritis to acute flaccid paralysis. However, these viruses were also frequently detected in asymptomatic subjects and their clinical relevance remains to be elucidated. The Enterovirus genus is a prototype example of the Picornaviridae heterogeneity at both genetic and phenotypic levels. This genus is divided into 10 species, seven of which contain human viruses, including three Rhinovirus species. Both human rhino- and enteroviruses are also characterized by high levels of genetic variability, as exemplified by the existence of over 250 different serotypes and the recent discovery of new enterovirus genotypes and the Rhinovirus C species. Despite their common genomic features, rhinoviruses are restricted to the respiratory tract, whereas the vast majority of enteroviruses infect the gastrointestinal tract and can spread to other organs, such as the heart or the central nervous system. Understanding the genetic determinants of such phenotypic diversity is an important challenge and a field for future investigation. Better characterization of these ubiquitous human pathogens may help to develop vaccines or antiviral treatments and to monitor the emergence of new strains. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Viral myocarditis is an important cause of heart failure for which no specific treatments are available. Direct viral injury to cardiac cells provokes an inflammatory response that significantly contributes to cardiac damage and ensuing morbidity. Despite the central pathogenic role of autoimmune injury, broad inhibition of the inflammatory response does not result in patient benefit. Many preclinical studies collectively emphasize that modulating distinct inflammatory signaling pathways may yield effective viral clearance while preserving cardiac structure. This review aims to provide an overview of the sometimes contrasting observations from experimental viral myocarditis models and to translate the lessons learned into opportunities for future investigations and therapies. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Picornaviruses, small positive-stranded RNA viruses, cause a wide range of diseases which is based on their differential tissue and cell type tropisms. This diversity is reflected by the immune responses, both innate and adaptive, induced after infection, and the subsequent interactions of the viruses with the immune system. The defense mechanisms of the host and the countermeasures of the virus significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of the infections. Important human pathogens are poliovirus, coxsackievirus, human rhinovirus and hepatitis A virus. These viruses are the best-studied members of the family, and in this review we want to present the major aspects of the reciprocal effects between the immune system and these viruses.},

abstract = {Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart frequently resulting from viral infections and/or post-viral immune-mediated responses. It is one of the important causes of dilated cardiomyopathy worldwide. The diagnosis is presumed on clinical presentation and noninvasive diagnostic methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard for in vivo diagnosis of myocarditis. The therapeutic and prognostic benefits of endomyocardial biopsy results have recently been demonstrated in several clinical trials. Although remarkable advances in diagnosis, understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment of acute myocarditis were gained during the last years, no standard treatment strategies could be defined as yet, apart from standard heart failure therapy and physical rest. In severe cases, mechanical support or heart transplantation may become necessary. There is some evidence that immunosuppressive and immunomodulating therapy are effective for chronic, virus-negative inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Further investigations by controlled, randomized studies are needed to definitively determine their role in the treatment of myocarditis. ?? 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},
