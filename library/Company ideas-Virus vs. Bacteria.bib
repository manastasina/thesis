abstract = {Improved ways to diagnose acute respiratory viral infections could decrease inappropriate antibacterial use and serve as a vital triage mechanism in the event of a potential viral pandemic. Measurement of the host response to infection is an alternative to pathogen-based diagnostic testing and may improve diagnostic accuracy. We have developed a host-based assay with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) platform for classifying respiratory viral infection. We developed the assay using two cohorts experimentally infected with influenza A H3N2/Wisconsin or influenza A H1N1/Brisbane, and validated the assay in a sample of adults presenting to the emergency department with fever (n = 102) and in healthy volunteers (n = 41). Peripheral blood RNA samples were obtained from individuals who underwent experimental viral challenge or who presented to the emergency department and had microbiologically proven viral respiratory infection or systemic bacterial infection. The selected gene set on the RT-PCR TLDA assay classified participants with experimentally induced influenza H3N2 and H1N1 infection with 100 and 87\% accuracy, respectively. We validated this host gene expression signature in a cohort of 102 individuals arriving at the emergency department. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR test was 89\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 72 to 98\%], and the specificity was 94\% (95\% CI, 86 to 99\%). These results show that RT-PCR-based detection of a host gene expression signature can classify individuals with respiratory viral infection and sets the stage for prospective evaluation of this diagnostic approach in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Timely knowledge of the bacterial etiology and localization of infection are important for empirical antibiotic therapy. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate routinely used biomarkers together with novel laboratory parameters in the diagnosis of infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In this prospective study, 54 adult patients with bacterial infections admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases were included. For comparison, 27 patients with viral infections were enrolled. In these patients, white blood cell (WBC) counts, differential blood counts, serum levels of procalcitonin (PCT), IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$, soluble CD14 (sCD14), heparin-binding protein (HBP), cortisol (Cort), and monocyte surface expression of TLR2, TLR4, HLA-DR, and CD14 were analyzed. Also, these biomarkers were evaluated in 21 patients with acute community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), as well as in 21 patients with pyelonephritis and urosepsis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The highest sensitivity and specificity (expressed as the area under the curve [AUC]) for bacterial infection were observed in serum concentration of PCT (0.952), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts (0.852 and 0.841, respectively), and serum levels of HBP (0.837), IL-6 (0.830), and Cort (0.817). In addition, the serum levels of IFN-$\gamma$ and Cort were significantly higher and IL-8 levels were lower in CABP when compared to pyelonephritis or urosepsis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: From the novel potential biomarkers, only PCT demonstrated superiority over the routine parameters in the differentiation of bacterial from viral infections. However, some of the novel parameters should be further evaluated in larger and better characterized cohorts of patients in order to find their clinical applications.},

@article{Chieux1998,
abstract = {Interferon alpha (IFN$\alpha$), a type I interferon, can be considered as a viral infection marker because this cytokine is induced during many viral infections. However, it is quite difficult to detect IFN$\alpha$ in sera. Investigations are interested in various intra-cellular IFN$\alpha$-induced proteins as viral infection markers. However the activity of these enzymes increased not only in response to type I IFNs but also to type II IFN. MxA protein can be detected in the cytoplasm of IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$-treated cells, whereas other cytokines, including IFN$\gamma$, are poor inducers. Using an immunochemiluminescent assay, we studied MxA protein in whole blood of 34 patients with various viral infections. The whole blood was drawn into sterile vacuum tubes containing heparin or EDTA. MxA values were relatively similar in heparin-treated samples and EDTA-treated samples, with differences not exceeding 1 ng/ml. The levels of MxA protein were compared in whole blood obtained by using two different lysis procedures. A correlation was found between the MxA levels obtained by using procedure I and procedure II, but higher amounts of MxA protein were found with procedure II. The second procedure is rapid and more convenient than the other and it is carried out in one step which reduce technical problems. High levels of MxA protein were found in peripheral blood cells of patients with acute viral infections (Rotavirus, Adenovirus, RSV, CMV), but MxA protein was not elevated in bacterial infections. The MxA levels were also studied in peripheral blood of 32 HCV positive patients. MxA protein was not found in most of IFN$\alpha$-untreated patients, even those with high viral load. In contrast, high levels of MxA protein were found in IFN$\alpha$-treated patients. MxA quantitation can be considered as a specific marker of acute viral infections, and could be useful in the management of treatment with IFN$\alpha$.},
