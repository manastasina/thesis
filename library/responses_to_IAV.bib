abstract = {eIF2 plays a central role in the maintenance of what is generally considered a rate-limiting step in mRNA translation. In this step, eIF2 binds GTP and Met-tRNAi and transfers Met-tRNAi to the 40S ribosomal subunit. At the end of the initiation process, GTP bound to eIF2 is hydrolyzed to GDP and the eIF2.GDP complex is released from the ribosome. The exchange of GDP bound to eIF2 for GTP is a prerequisite to binding Met-tRNAi and is mediated by a second initiation factor, eIF2B. In what is probably the best-characterized mechanism for the regulation of mRNA translation, phosphorylation of eIF2 on its smallest, or alpha-, subunit converts eIF2 from a substrate of eIF2B into a competitive inhibitor. Thus, phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha effectively prevents formation of the eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAi complex and inhibits global protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha occurs under a variety of conditions including viral infection, apoptosis, nutrient deprivation, heme-deprivation, and certain stresses.},

Among the host's arsenal of antimicrobial factors, the type 1 interferons (IFNs) induce potent defense mechanisms against viruses and are key in the host-virus standoff. Viruses have evolved multiple tricks to avoid the immediate antiviral effects of IFNs and, in turn, hosts have adapted use of this innate cytokine system to galvanize multiple additional layers of immune defense. The plasticity that exists in these interactions provides us with a lesson in d\'{e}tente.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that a member of the interleukin-1 (IL-1)/Toll receptor superfamily, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Because of the similarity in their cytoplasmic domains, IL-1/Toll receptors share signaling components that associate with the IL-1 receptor, including IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), MyD88, and TRAF6. However, we find that, in response to dsRNA, TLR3 can mediate the activation of both NFkappaB and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in IL-1-unresponsive mutant cell lines, including IRAK-deficient I1A and I3A cells, which are defective in a component that is downstream of IL-1R but upstream of IRAK. These results clearly indicate that TLR3 does not simply share the signaling components employed by the IL-1 receptor. Through biochemical analyses we have identified an IRAK-independent TLR3-mediated pathway. Upon binding of dsRNA to TLR3, TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 are recruited to the receptor to form a complex, which then translocates to the cytosol where TAK1 is phosphorylated and activated. The dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is also detected in this signal-induced TAK1 complex. Kinase inactive mutants of TAK1 (TAK1DN) and PKR (PKRDN) inhibit poly(dI.dC)-induced TLR3-mediated NFkappaB activation, suggesting that both of these kinases play important roles in this pathway.},

Double-stranded RNA is a marker for viral infection that is recognized by TLR3. TLR3 triggering activates specific signaling pathways that culminate in the activation of NF-kappaB and IRF3 transcription factors, as well as apoptosis, enabling the host to mount an effective innate immune response through the induction of cytokines, chemokines, and other proinflammatory mediators. In this review, we describe the paradoxical role of TLR3 in innate immunity against different viruses and in viral pathogenesis but also the evidence for TLR3 as a "danger" receptor in nonviral diseases. We also discuss the structure and cellular localization of TLR3, as well as the complex signaling and regulatory events that contribute to TLR3-mediated immune responses.},

abstract = {Cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens plays an important role in regulating CD8+ T cell responses to proteins that are not expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Dendritic cells are the principal cross-presenting APCs in vivo and much progress has been made in elucidating the pathways that allow dendritic cells to capture and process cellular material. However, little is known about the signals that determine whether such presentation ultimately results in a cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response (cross-priming) or in CD8+ T cell inactivation (cross-tolerance). Here we describe a mechanism that promotes cross-priming during viral infections. We show that murine CD8alpha+ dendritic cells are activated by double-stranded (ds)RNA present in virally infected cells but absent from uninfected cells. Dendritic cell activation requires phagocytosis of infected material, followed by signalling through the dsRNA receptor, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Immunization with virus-infected cells or cells containing synthetic dsRNA leads to a striking increase in CTL cross-priming against cell-associated antigens, which is largely dependent on TLR3 expression by antigen-presenting cells. Thus, TLR3 may have evolved to permit cross-priming of CTLs against viruses that do not directly infect dendritic cells.},

abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that innate immunity is involved in the development of adaptive immune responses; however, its role in protection is not clear. In order to elucidate the exact role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) or RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling on immunogenicity and protective efficacy against influenza A virus infection (A/PR/8/34 [PR8]; H1N1), we adapted several innate signal-deficient mice (e.g., TRIF(-/-), MyD88(-/-), MyD88(-/-) TRIF(-/-), TLR3(-/-) TLR7(-/-), and IPS-1(-/-)). In this study, we found that MyD88 signaling was required for recruitment of CD11b(+) granulocytes, production of early inflammatory cytokines, optimal proliferation of CD4 T cells, and production of Th1 cytokines by T cells. However, PR8 virus-specific IgG and IgA antibody levels in both systemic and mucosal compartments were normal in TLR- and RLR-deficient mice. To further assess the susceptibility of these mice to influenza virus infection, protective efficacy was determined after primary or secondary lethal challenge. We found that MyD88(-/-) and MyD88(-/-) TRIF(-/-) mice were more susceptible to primary influenza virus infection than the B6 mice but were fully protected against homologous (H1N1) and heterosubtypic (H5N2) secondary infection when primed with a nonlethal dose of PR8 virus. Taken together, these results show that MyD88 signaling plays an important role for resisting primary influenza virus infection but is dispensable for protection against a secondary lethal challenge.},

The protein specifically recognizes 5'-triphosphorylated RNA structures that are released into the cell by viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C. To understand the energetic basis for viral RNA recognition by RIG-I, we studied the binding of RIG-I domain variants to a family of dsRNA ligands. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the isolated RIG-I domains each make important contributions to affinity and that they interact using different strategies. Covalent linkage between the domains enhances RNA ligand specificity while reducing overall binding affinity, thereby providing a mechanism for discriminating virus from host RNA.},

Virtually all viruses have developed means to counteract the induction, signaling, or antiviral actions of the IFN circuit. Over 170 different virus-encoded IFN antagonists from 93 distinct viruses have been described up to now, indicating that most viruses interfere with multiple stages of the IFN response. Although every viral IFN antagonist is unique in its own right, four main mechanisms are employed to circumvent innate immune responses: (i) general inhibition of cellular gene expression, (ii) sequestration of molecules in the IFN circuit, (iii) proteolytic cleavage, and (iv) proteasomal degradation of key components of the IFN system. The increasing understanding of how different viral IFN antagonists function has been translated to the generation of viruses with mutant IFN antagonists as potential live vaccine candidates. Moreover, IFN antagonists are attractive targets for inhibition by small-molecule compounds. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The cytoplasmic helicase proteins RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible protein I, also known as Ddx58) and MDA5 (melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5, also known as Ifih1 or Helicard) have been implicated in viral dsRNA recognition. In vitro studies suggest that both RIG-I and MDA5 detect RNA viruses and polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic dsRNA analogue. Although a critical role for RIG-I in the recognition of several RNA viruses has been clarified, the functional role of MDA5 and the relationship between these dsRNA detectors in vivo are yet to be determined. Here we use mice deficient in MDA5 (MDA5-/-) to show that MDA5 and RIG-I recognize different types of dsRNAs: MDA5 recognizes poly(I:C), and RIG-I detects in vitro transcribed dsRNAs. RNA viruses are also differentially recognized by RIG-I and MDA5. We find that RIG-I is essential for the production of interferons in response to RNA viruses including paramyxoviruses, influenza virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, whereas MDA5 is critical for picornavirus detection. Furthermore, RIG-I-/- and MDA5-/- mice are highly susceptible to infection with these respective RNA viruses compared to control mice. Together, our data show that RIG-I and MDA5 distinguish different RNA viruses and are critical for host antiviral responses.},

We addressed this question by characterizing the immune cell populations in the mouse lung following infection with the 1918 pandemic virus and two H5N1 viruses isolated from fatal cases. Our data shows excessive immune cell infiltration in the lungs contributing to severe consolidation and tissue architecture destruction in mice infected with highly pathogenic (HP) influenza viruses, supporting the histopathological observations of lung tissue from 1918 and H5N1 fatalities. We found that certain cells of the innate immune system, specifically macrophages and neutrophils, increase significantly into the mouse lung shortly following HP virus infection. Interestingly, lung macrophages and dendritic cells were shown to be susceptible to 1918 and H5N1 virus infection in vitro or ex vivo, suggesting a possible mechanism of immunopathogenesis.

abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis of various tumor cells but not normal cells. However, various cytokines and virus infection differentially regulate TRAIL and TRAIL receptor expression. It has been demonstrated that virus infection changes the pattern of human TRAIL-receptor expression on normal cells, which were resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, and makes them susceptible to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Since previous studies on the function of TRAIL have been performed mainly in vitro, its physiological role in the immune response to virus infection remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the expression of TRAIL in the lungs of influenza virus-infected mice and the function of TRAIL in the immune response to infection. Influenza virus infection increased TRAIL mRNA expression in the lung. TRAIL protein expression was induced on NK cells in the lung 4 days after infection. At 7 days after infection, TRAIL protein expression was also detected on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. However, NK cells and T cells in the lungs of uninfected mice did not express a detectable level of TRAIL on their cell surfaces. DR5, which is a mouse TRAIL receptor, was also induced to express after virus infection. Expression of both TRAIL and DR5 mRNAs was reduced to normal level at 6 weeks after virus infection. Administration of anti-TRAIL monoclonal antibody, which blocks TRAIL without killing TRAIL-expressing cells, to mice during influenza virus infection significantly delayed virus clearance in the lung. These results suggest that TRAIL plays an important role in the immune response to virus infection.},

abstract = {T helper 1 driven immune responses facilitate host defence during viral infections. Because interleukin-18 (IL-18) mediates T helper 1 driven immune responses, and since mature IL-18 is up-regulated in human macrophages after influenza virus infection in vitro, it has been suggested that IL-18 plays an important role in the immune response to influenza. To determine the role of IL-18 in respiratory tract infection with influenza, IL-18 gene-deficient (IL-18(-/-)) and normal wildtype mice were intranasally inoculated with influenza A virus. Influenza resulted in an increase in constitutively expressed IL-18 in the lungs of wildtype mice. The clearance of influenza A was inhibited by IL-18, as indicated by reduced viral loads on day 8 and day 12 after infection in IL-18(-/-) mice. This enhanced viral clearance correlated with increased CD4(+) T-cell activation in the lungs as reflected by CD69 expression on the cell surface. Surprisingly, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels were similar in the lungs of IL-18(-/-) mice and wildtype mice. Intracellular IFN-gamma staining revealed similar expression levels in lung-derived natural killer cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, indicating that IFN-gamma production is IL-18-independent during influenza virus infection. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by CD4(+) T cells was significantly lower in IL-18(-/-) mice than in wildtype mice. Our data indicate that endogenous IL-18 impairs viral clearance during influenza A infection.},

In this review, we will explore what is known about the role of apoptosis in respiratory epithelial cell damage and the role of cytokines in inflammation and constitutional symptoms with particular emphasis on the link between apoptosis, inflammation, fever and cytokine production. ?? 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

In turn, viruses encode mechanisms to counteract the host response and support efficient viral replication, thereby minimizing the therapeutic antiviral power of IFNs. In this review, we discuss the interplay between the IFN system and four medically important and challenging viruses -- influenza, hepatitis C, herpes simplex and vaccinia -- to highlight the diversity of viral strategies. Understanding the complex network of cellular antiviral processes and virus-host interactions should aid in identifying new and common targets for the therapeutic intervention of virus infection. This effort must take advantage of the recent developments in functional genomics, bioinformatics and other emerging technologies.},

Recently, we established a role for the pattern-recognition TLR3 in the response of lung epithelial cells to IAV-derived dsRNA. However, additional nucleic acid-recognition proteins have lately been implicated as key viral sensors, including the RNA helicases retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA)-5. In this study, we investigated the respective role of TLR3 vs RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling in human respiratory epithelial cells infected by IAV using BEAS-2B cells transfected with vectors encoding either a dominant-negative form of TLR3 or of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS; a signaling intermediate of RIG-I and MDA-5), or with plasmids overexpressing functional RIG-I or MDA-5. We demonstrate that the sensing of IAV by TLR3 primarily regulates a proinflammatory response, whereas RIG-I (but not MDA-5) mediates both a type I IFN-dependent antiviral signaling and a proinflammatory response.},

IFN-gamma, a pleiotropic cytokine, elicits gene expression by activating the Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway. IFN-gamma can synergize with TNF-alpha to activate NF-kappaB in a number of cell lines. Here we show that IFN-gamma alone can activate NF-kappaB, by a Janus kinase-1-mediated, but Stat1-independent, mechanism. NF-kappaB activation by IFN-gamma is associated with degradation of IkappaB beta. The IFN-gamma response can be blocked by 2',5'-oligoadenylate-linked antisense chimeras against PKR mRNA. There was no activation of NF-kappaB by IFN in PKR-null cells, indicating that PKR is required for IFN-gamma signaling to NF-kappaB.},

We have investigated the role of IL-1 during pulmonary antiviral immune responses in IL-1R1(-/-) mice infected with influenza virus. IL-1R1(-/-) mice showed markedly reduced inflammatory pathology in the lung, primarily due to impaired neutrophil recruitment. Activation of CD4(+) T cells in secondary lymphoid organs and subsequent migration to the lung were impaired in the absence of IL-1R1. In contrast, activation of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and killing of virus-infected cells in the lung were intact. Influenza virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody responses were intact, while the IgM response was markedly reduced in both serum and mucosal sites in IL-1R1(-/-) mice. We found significantly increased mortality in the absence of IL-1R1; however, lung viral titers were only moderately increased. Our results demonstrate that IL-1alpha/beta mediate acute pulmonary inflammatory pathology while enhancing survival during influenza virus infection. IL-1alpha/beta appear not to influence killing of virus-infected cells but to enhance IgM antibody responses and recruitment of CD4(+) T cells to the site of infection.},

To this purpose, we generated a knock-in mouse in which the Nlrp3 coding sequence was substituted for the GFP (enhanced GFP [egfp]) gene. In this way, the expression of eGFP is driven by the endogenous regulatory elements of the Nlrp3 gene. In this study, we show that eGFP expression indeed mirrors that of NLRP3. Interestingly, splenic neutrophils, macrophages, and, in particular, monocytes and conventional dendritic cells showed robust eGFP fluorescence, whereas lymphoid subsets, eosinophils, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells showed negligible eGFP levels. NLRP3 expression was highly inducible in macrophages, both by MyD88- and Trif-dependent pathways. In vivo, when mice were challenged with diverse inflammatory stimuli, differences in both the number of eGFP-expressing cells and fluorescence intensity were observed in the draining lymph node. Thus, NLRP3 levels at the site of adaptive response initiation are controlled by recruitment of NLRP3-expressing cells and by NLRP3 induction.},

In this study, we report that avian influenza virus (AIV) activates ERK, p38 and Jun-N-terminal kinases in avian species. In chicken macrophages, while ERK was required for H9N2 AIV replication, ERK regulated proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8, which is distinct from what has been previously reported in mammalian cells. Moreover, ERK alone suppressed TNF-alpha and FasL and inhibited TNF-family-mediated extrinsic apoptosis in H9N2-infected chicken macrophages. Taken together, these findings suggest that ERK signalling may uniquely play important roles in avian host responses to AIV infection.},

abstract = {The innate immune system is a universal and ancient form of host defense against infection. Innate immune recognition relies on a limited number of germline-encoded receptors. These receptors evolved to recognize conserved products of microbial metabolism produced by microbial pathogens, but not by the host. Recognition of these molecular structures allows the immune system to distinguish infectious nonself from noninfectious self. Toll-like receptors play a major role in pathogen recognition and initiation of inflammatory and immune responses. Stimulation of Toll-like receptors by microbial products leads to the activation of signaling pathways that result in the induction of antimicrobial genes and inflammatory cytokines. In addition, stimulation of Toll-like receptors triggers dendritic cell maturation and results in the induction of costimulatory molecules and increased antigen-presenting capacity. Thus, microbial recognition by Toll-like receptors helps to direct adaptive immune responses to antigens derived from microbial pathogens.},

In recent years, the Interferon Gateway encompassing interferon-alpha and -beta (IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$) expression, signalling and antiviral responses, has been uncovered. IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$ are cytokines that co-ordinate the innate and adaptive immune responses to eliminate virus infections from the host. Interferon Stimulated Gene (ISG) products, such as protein kinase R, can prevent the translation of viral and cellular mRNAs to limit viral replication and can also initiate apoptosis if the cell is overwhelmed. In order to replicate, viruses have evolved viral evasion proteins that are able to target all aspects of the host response through a variety of sophisticated mechanisms. Viral evasion proteins can encode cellular domains to interact directly with ISGs and neutralize their function, hijack cellular pathways or degrade antiviral components. The high mutation rates associated with viral replication ensure that viruses will continue to adapt to our defences, but equally the viral evasion proteins are novel drug targets for eliminating or managing virus infections},

abstract = {Interferons (IFNs) are a critical component of the first line of antiviral defense. The activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed by dendritic cells triggers different signaling cascades that result in the production of large amounts of IFNs. However, the functional consequences of TLR activation and differential IFN production in specific cell populations other than antigen-presenting cells have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated TLR expression and polarization in airway epithelial cells (AECs) and the consequences of TLR agonist stimulation for the production of type I (IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$) and type III (IFN-$\lambda$) IFNs. Our results show that the pattern of expression and polarization of all TLRs in primary AEC cultures mirrors that of the human airways ex vivo and is receptor specific. The antiviral TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9) are mostly expressed on the apical cell surfaces of epithelial cells in the human trachea and in primary polarized AECs. Type III IFN is the predominant IFN produced by the airway epithelium, and TLR3 is the only TLR that mediates IFN production by AECs, while all TLR agonists tested are capable of inducing AEC activation and interleukin-8 production. In response to influenza virus infection, AECs can produce IFN-$\lambda$ in an IFNAR- and STAT1-independent manner. Our results emphasize the importance of using primary well-differentiated AECs to study TLR and antiviral responses and provide further insight into the regulation of IFN production during the antiviral response of the lung epithelium.},

MxA partially localizes to COPI-positive membranes of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. At the point of infection, it redistributes to sites of viral replication and promotes missorting of essential viral constituents. It has been proposed that the middle domain and the GTPase effector domain of dynamin-like GTPases constitute a stalk that mediates oligomerization and transmits conformational changes from the G domain to the target structure; however, the molecular architecture of this stalk has remained elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of the stalk of human MxA, which folds into a four-helical bundle. This structure tightly oligomerizes in the crystal in a criss-cross pattern involving three distinct interfaces and one loop. Mutations in each of these interaction sites interfere with native assembly, oligomerization, membrane binding and antiviral activity of MxA. On the basis of these results, we propose a structural model for dynamin oligomerization and stimulated GTP hydrolysis that is consistent with previous structural predictions and has functional implications for all members of the dynamin family.},

abstract = {The immunologic response to influenza virus infection, like many other viruses, is characterized by robust production of proinflammatory cytokines, including type I and II interferon (IFN), which induce a number of antiviral effects and are essential for priming the innate and adaptive cellular components of the immune response. Here, we demonstrate that influenza virus infection induces the expression of functional tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations. Consistent with previous studies examining TRAIL upregulation, increased TRAIL expression correlated with increased type I and II IFN levels in PBMC cultures. Interestingly, dilution of these cytokines resulted in decreased expression of TRAIL. TRAIL upregulation was not dependent on active viral infection, and TRAIL was observed on NS-1-negative cells. Furthermore, influenza virus infection of lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) resulted in increased sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis compared with uninfected A549. Infected PBMC expressing TRAIL preferentially killed infected A549, but did not affect uninfected cells, and the addition of soluble TRAIL-R2:Fc blocked the lysis of infected cells, demonstrating TRAIL-dependent killing of infected cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TRAIL expression is induced on primary human innate and adaptive immune cells in response to cytokines produced during influenza infection and that TRAIL sensitivity is increased in influenza virus-infected cells. These data also suggest that TRAIL is a primary mechanism used by influenza-stimulated human PBMC to kill influenza-infected target cells and reinforce the importance of cytokines produced in response to TLR agonists in enhancing cellular immune effector functions. ?? 2008 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.},

Recently, we demonstrated, using an in vitro approach, that the pattern recognition Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 plays a key role in the immune response of lung epithelial cells to IAV. In view of these data and the fact that the functional role of TLR3 in vivo is still debated, we designed an investigation to better understand the role of TLR3 in the mechanisms of IAV pathogenesis and host immune response using an experimental murine model. The time-course of several dynamic parameters, including animal survival, respiratory suffering, viral clearance, leukocyte recruitment into the airspaces and secretion of critical inflammatory mediators, was compared in infected wild-type and TLR3(-/-) mice. First, we found that the pulmonary expression of TLR3 is constitutive and markedly upregulated following influenza infection in control mice. Notably, when compared to wild-type mice, infected TLR3-/- animals displayed significantly reduced inflammatory mediators, including RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), interleukin-6, and interleukin-12p40/p70 as well as a lower number of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar airspace. More important, despite a higher viral production in the lungs, mice deficient in TLR3 had an unexpected survival advantage. Hence, to our knowledge, our findings show for the first time that TLR3-IAV interaction critically contributes to the debilitating effects of a detrimental host inflammatory response.},

We found that RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) induce type III interferon expression in a variety of human cell types, and identified factors that differentially regulate expression of type I and type III interferons. We identified peroxisomes as a primary site of initiation of type III interferon expression, and revealed that the process of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation upregulates peroxisome biogenesis and promotes robust type III interferon responses in human cells. These findings highlight the importance of different intracellular organelles in specific innate immune responses.},

abstract = {Virus-induced interlukin-1?? (IL-1??) and IL-18 production in macrophages are mediated via caspase-1 pathway. Multiple microbial components, including viral RNA, are thought to trigger assembly of the cryopyrin inflammasome resulting in caspase-1 activation. Here, we demonstrated that Nlrp3-/- and Casp1-/- mice were more susceptible than wild-type mice after infection with a pathogenic influenza A virus. This enhanced morbidity correlated with decreased neutrophil and monocyte recruitment and reduced cytokine and chemokine production. Despite the effect on innate immunity, cryopyrin-deficiency was not associated with any obvious defect in virus control or on the later emergence of the adaptive response. Early epithelial necrosis was, however, more severe in the infected mutants, with extensive collagen deposition leading to later respiratory compromise. These findings reveal a function of the cryopyrin inflammasome in healing responses. Thus, cryopyrin and caspase-1 are central to both innate immunity and to moderating lung pathology in influenza pneumonia. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nucleic acid-induced gene silencing, such as RNA interference (RNAi), induces a multitude of responses in addition to the knockdown of a gene. This is best understood in the context of the antiviral immune response, from which the processes of RNAi are thought to be derived. Viral challenge of a vertebrate host leads to an intricate series of responses that orchestrate antiviral immunity. The success of this multifaceted system in overcoming viral encounters hinges on complex pathogen-host interactions. One aspect of these interactions, the nucleic acid-based immune response, is key to the successful resolution of a viral challenge. In particular, dsRNA, a nucleic acid associated with viral replication, is involved in numerous interactions contributing to induction, activation and regulation of antiviral mechanisms. Specifically, dsRNA is responsible for stimulating important protective responses, such as the activation of dicer-related antiviral pathways, induction of type 1 IFN, and stimulation of dsRNA-activated protein kinase and oligoadenylate synthetase. Furthermore, the modulation and shaping of this overall immune response is facilitated through nucleic acid interactions with pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptor 3. These diverse dsRNA-induced antiviral responses have implications for biotechnologies that use dsRNA to harness one arm of the host antiviral machinery for silencing a specific target gene. The interlinked nature of these response elements means that it may be difficult to completely isolate one element from the other arms of the antiviral response program of an organism. Thus, it is beneficial to understand all aspects of the immune response to dsRNA in order to manipulate these systems and minimize unwanted non-specific effects.},

Here we report that PKR is involved in IFN- and dsRNA-signaling pathways by modulating the function of the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT1. We also show that PKR associates with STAT1 in mouse and human cells. The association is not a kinase-substrate interaction since STAT1 phosphorylation is not modified by PKR in vitro or in vivo. In addition, the formation of the PKR-STAT1 complex is not dependent upon the enzymatic activity of PKR but does require the dsRNA-binding domain of PKR. Moreover, there is a concomitant decrease in PKR-STAT1 interaction and increase in STAT1 DNA binding in response to IFNs or dsRNA. These findings suggest that PKR plays an important role in IFN and dsRNA-signaling pathways by modulating the transcriptional function of STAT1.},

abstract = {Apoptosis is a hallmark event observed upon infection with many viral pathogens, including influenza A virus. The apoptotic process is executed by a proteolytic system consisting of a family of cysteinyl proteases, termed caspases. Since the consequences of apoptosis induction and caspase activation for the outcome of an influenza virus infection are not clear, we have addressed this issue by interfering with expression or function of a major virus-induced apoptosis effector, caspase 3. Surprisingly, influenza virus propagation was strongly impaired in the presence of an inhibitor that blocks caspase 3 and in cells where caspase 3 was partially knocked down by small interfering RNAs. Consistent with these findings, poor replication efficiencies of influenza A viruses in cells deficient for caspase 3 could be boosted 30-fold by ectopic expression of the protein. Mechanistically, the block in virus propagation appeared to be due to retention of the viral RNP complexes in the nucleus, preventing formation of progeny virus particles. Our findings indicate that caspase 3 activation during the onset of apoptosis is a crucial event for efficient influenza virus propagation.},

abstract = {The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein family represents a new class of cellular restriction factors that block early stages of viral replication; the underlying mechanism is currently not known. Here we provide evidence that IFITM proteins restrict membrane fusion induced by representatives of all three classes of viral membrane fusion proteins. IFITM1 profoundly suppressed syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion induced by almost all viral fusion proteins examined; IFITM2 and IFITM3 also strongly inhibited their fusion, with efficiency somewhat dependent on cell types. Furthermore, treatment of cells with IFN also markedly inhibited viral membrane fusion and entry. By using the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus envelope and influenza A virus hemagglutinin as models for study, we showed that IFITM-mediated restriction on membrane fusion is not at the steps of receptor- and/or low pH-mediated triggering; instead, the creation of hemifusion was essentially blocked by IFITMs. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a chemical known to promote the transition from hemifusion to full fusion, was unable to rescue the IFITM-mediated restriction on fusion. In contrast, oleic acid (OA), a lipid analog that generates negative spontaneous curvature and thereby promotes hemifusion, virtually overcame the restriction. To explore the possible effect of IFITM proteins on membrane molecular order and fluidity, we performed fluorescence labeling with Laurdan, in conjunction with two-photon laser scanning and fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). We observed that the generalized polarizations (GPs) and fluorescence lifetimes of cell membranes expressing IFITM proteins were greatly enhanced, indicating higher molecularly ordered and less fluidized membranes. Collectively, our data demonstrated that IFITM proteins suppress viral membrane fusion before the creation of hemifusion, and suggested that they may do so by reducing membrane fluidity and conferring a positive spontaneous curvature in the outer leaflets of cell membranes. Our study provides novel insight into the understanding of how IFITM protein family restricts viral membrane fusion and infection.},

Expression of type I and III interferons is induced in virtually all cell types upon recognition of viral molecular patterns, especially nucleic acids, by cytoplasmic and endosomal receptors, whereas type II interferon is induced by cytokines such as IL-12, and its expression is restricted to immune cells such as T cells and NK cells. The effectiveness of the interferon system in counteracting viral infections is reflected by the multitude of inhibitors of interferon induction or interferon action that are encoded by many viruses, preventing their eradication and resulting in the continued coexistence of viruses and vertebrates.

abstract = {Detection of non-self RNA by TLRs within endosomes and by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases in the cytosol is central to mammalian antiviral immunity. In this study, we used pathway-specific agonists and targeted delivery to address RNA immunorecognition in primary human immune cells. Within PBMC, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and monocytes were found to be responsible for IFN-alpha production upon immunorecognition of RNA. The mechanisms of RNA recognition in pDC and monocytes were distinct. In pDC, recognition of ssRNA and dsRNA oligonucleotides was TLR7-dependent, whereas a 5' triphosphate moiety (RIG-I ligand activity) had no major contribution to IFN-alpha production. In monocytes, the response to RNA oligonucleotides was mediated by either TLR8 or RIG-I. TLR8 was responsible for IL-12 induction upon endosomal delivery of ssRNA oligonucleotides and RIG-I was responsible for IFN-alpha production upon delivery of 5' triphosphate RNA into the cytosol. In conclusion, the dissection of these pathways by selecting the appropriate structure and delivery of RNA reveals pDC as major producer of IFN-alpha upon TLR-mediated stimulation and monocytes as major producer of IFN-alpha upon RIG-I-mediated stimulation. Furthermore, our results uncover the potential of monocytes to function as major producers of IL-12p70, a key Th1 cytokine classically ascribed to myeloid dendritic cells that cannot be induced by CpG oligonucleotides in the human system.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) triggers a contagious and potentially lethal respiratory disease. A protective IL-1$\beta$ response is mediated by innate receptors in macrophages and lung epithelial cells. NLRP3 is crucial in macrophages; however, which sensors elicit IL-1$\beta$ secretion in lung epithelial cells remains undetermined. Here, we describe for the first time the relative roles of the host innate receptors RIG-I (DDX58), TLR3, and NLRP3 in the IL-1$\beta$ response to IAV in primary lung epithelial cells. To activate IL-1$\beta$ secretion, these cells employ partially redundant recognition mechanisms that differ from those described in macrophages. RIG-I had the strongest effect through a MAVS/TRIM25/Riplet-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway upstream of TLR3 and NLRP3. Notably, RIG-I also activated the inflammasome through interaction with caspase 1 and ASC in primary lung epithelial cells. Thus, NS1, an influenza virulence factor that inhibits the RIG-I/type I IFN pathway, strongly modulated the IL-1$\beta$ response in lung epithelial cells and in ferrets. The NS1 protein derived from a highly pathogenic strain resulted in increased interaction with RIG-I and inhibited type I IFN and IL-1$\beta$ responses compared to the least pathogenic virus strains. These findings demonstrate that in IAV-infected lung epithelial cells RIG-I activates the inflammasome both directly and through a type I IFN positive feedback loop.},

abstract = {Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit infection of diverse enveloped viruses, including the influenza A virus (IAV) which is thought to enter from late endosomes. Recent evidence suggests that IFITMs block virus hemifusion (lipid mixing in the absence of viral content release) by altering the properties of cell membranes. Consistent with this mechanism, excess cholesterol in late endosomes of IFITM-expressing cells has been reported to inhibit IAV entry. Here, we examined IAV restriction by IFITM3 protein using direct virus-cell fusion assay and single virus imaging in live cells. IFITM3 over-expression did not inhibit lipid mixing, but abrogated the release of viral content into the cytoplasm. Although late endosomes of IFITM3-expressing cells accumulated cholesterol, other interventions leading to aberrantly high levels of this lipid did not inhibit virus fusion. These results imply that excess cholesterol in late endosomes is not the mechanism by which IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to full fusion. The IFITM3's ability to block fusion pore formation at a post-hemifusion stage shows that this protein stabilizes the cytoplasmic leaflet of endosomal membranes without adversely affecting the lumenal leaflet. We propose that IFITM3 interferes with pore formation either directly, through partitioning into the cytoplasmic leaflet of a hemifusion intermediate, or indirectly, by modulating the lipid/protein composition of this leaflet. Alternatively, IFITM3 may redirect IAV fusion to a non-productive pathway, perhaps by promoting fusion with intralumenal vesicles within multivesicular bodies/late endosomes.},

In addition, TLR signals are required for the CD4 T cell and IgG2a, but not cytotoxic T lymphocyte, responses to influenza virus infection. In contrast, the role of NOD-like receptors (NLRs) in viral recognition and induction of adaptive immunity to influenza virus is unknown. We demonstrate that respiratory infection with influenza virus results in the activation of NLR inflammasomes in the lung. Although NLRP3 was required for inflammasome activation in certain cell types, CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, as well as mucosal IgA secretion and systemic IgG responses, required ASC and caspase-1 but not NLRP3. Consequently, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1R, but not NLRP3, were required for protective immunity against flu challenge. Furthermore, we show that caspase-1 inflammasome activation in the hematopoietic, but not stromal, compartment was required to induce protective antiviral immunity. These results demonstrate that in addition to the TLR pathways, ASC inflammasomes play a central role in adaptive immunity to influenza virus.},

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a molecular pattern associated with viral infection, because it is produced by most viruses at some point during their replication. Here we show that mammalian TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, and that activation of the receptor induces the activation of NF-kappaB and the production of type I interferons (IFNs). TLR3-deficient (TLR3-/-) mice showed reduced responses to polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), resistance to the lethal effect of poly(I:C) when sensitized with d-galactosamine (d-GalN), and reduced production of inflammatory cytokines. MyD88 is an adaptor protein that is shared by all the known TLRs. When activated by poly(I:C), TLR3 induces cytokine production through a signalling pathway dependent on MyD88. Moreover, poly(I:C) can induce activation of NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases independently of MyD88, and cause dendritic cells to mature.},

abstract = {Type I interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) binds to cell surface receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 and triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. This response is a crucial component in innate immunity in that it establishes an "antiviral state" in cells and protects them against further damage. Previous work demonstrated that, compared with their differentiated counterparts, pluripotent human cells have a much weaker response to cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and are only able to produce a minimal amount of IFN-beta. We show here that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) also exhibit an attenuated response to IFN-beta. Even though all known type I IFN signaling components are expressed in these cells, STAT1 phosphorylation is greatly diminished upon IFN-$\beta$ treatment. This attenuated response correlates with a high expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). Upon differentiation of hESCs into trophoblasts, cells acquire the ability to respond to IFN-beta, and this is accompanied by a significant induction of STAT1 phosphorylation as well as a decrease in SOCS1 expression. Furthermore, SOCS1 knockdown in hiPSCs enhances their ability to respond to IFN-beta. Taken together, our results suggest that an attenuated cellular response to type I IFNs may be a general feature of pluripotent human cells and that this is associated with high expression of SOCS1.},

Mitogens and antigenic stimuli induce in lymphocytes type II immune IFN-italic gamma. Interferons seem to bind to specific receptors2 to elicit a variety of cellular responses3; several early studies provided indirect evidence for such binding4–6. Direct evidence for specific interferon receptors was presented by Aguet7, who showed that biologically active 125I-labelled mouse (Mu)IFN binds to sensitive L1210-S cells, but not to interferon-resistant L1210-R cells8. The main obstacle in carrying out such studies is the availability of pure interferon. Recently, Maeda et al.9 constructed plasmids containing human interferon sequences. The plasmid p104 was used as a probe to isolate the coding region of a human interferon (IFLrA), which was expressed in Escherichia coli10 and purified with monoclonal antibodies11. This interferon, designated HuIFN-alphaA, was labelled with 125I for binding assays on human cells. We have determined the specificity of different HuIFNs for the cellular sites which bind HuIFN-alphaA and show here that HuIFN-italic gamma does not compete for binding, whereas all type I HuIFNs do.},

It is absolutely dependent on the transcription factor IRF-7, which interacts with and is activated by the adaptor MyD88. How plasmacytoid dendritic cells, but not other cell types (such as conventional dendritic cells), are able to activate the MyD88-IRF-7-dependent IFN induction pathway remains unknown. Here we show that the spatiotemporal regulation of MyD88-IRF-7 signalling is critical for a high-level IFN induction in response to TLR9 activation. The IFN-inducing TLR9 ligand, A/D-type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-A), is retained for long periods in the endosomal vesicles of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, together with the MyD88-IRF-7 complex. However, in conventional dendritic cells, CpG-A is rapidly transferred to lysosomal vesicles. We further show that conventional dendritic cells can also mount a robust IFN induction if CpG-A is manipulated for endosomal retention using a cationic lipid. This strategy also allows us to demonstrate endosomal activation of the IFN pathway by the otherwise inactive TLR9 ligand B/K-type oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-B). Thus, our study offers insights into the regulation of TLR9 signalling in space, potentially suggesting a new avenue for therapeutic intervention.},

The interaction between respiratory viruses and airway epithelial cells results in production of antiviral substances, including type I and III interferons, lactoferrin, $\beta$-defensins, and nitric oxide, and also in production of cytokines and chemokines, which recruit inflammatory cells and influence adaptive immunity. These defense mechanisms usually result in rapid virus clearance. However, respiratory viruses elaborate strategies to evade antiviral mechanisms and immune responses. They may disrupt epithelial integrity through cytotoxic effects, increasing paracellular permeability and damaging epithelial repair mechanisms. In addition, they can interfere with immune responses by blocking interferon pathways and by subverting protective inflammatory responses toward detrimental ones. Finally, by inducing overt mucus secretion and mucostasis and by paving the way for bacterial infections, they favor lung damage and further impair host antiviral mechanisms.},

abstract = {The double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR is a critical mediator of the antiproliferative and antiviral effects exerted by interferons. Not only is PKR an effector molecule on the cellular response to double-stranded RNA, but it also integrates signals in response to Toll-like receptor activation, growth factors, and diverse cellular stresses. In this review, we provide a detailed picture on how signaling downstream of PKR unfolds and what are the ultimate consequences for the cell fate. PKR activation affects both transcription and translation. PKR phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 results in a blockade on translation initiation. However, PKR cannot avoid the translation of some cellular and viral mRNAs bearing special features in their 5' untranslated regions. In addition, PKR affects diverse transcriptional factors such as interferon regulatory factor 1, STATs, p53, activating transcription factor 3, and NF-kappaB. In particular, how PKR triggers a cascade of events involving IKK phosphorylation of IkappaB and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation has been intensively studied. At the cellular and organism levels PKR exerts antiproliferative effects, and it is a key antiviral agent. A point of convergence in both effects is that PKR activation results in apoptosis induction. The extent and strength of the antiviral action of PKR are clearly understood by the findings that unrelated viral proteins of animal viruses have evolved to inhibit PKR action by using diverse strategies. The case for the pathological consequences of the antiproliferative action of PKR is less understood, but therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting PKR are beginning to offer promising results.},

In addition, PKR mediates apoptosis induced by many different stimuli, such as treatment with LPS, TNF-alpha, viral infection, or serum starvation. The mechanism of apoptosis induction by PKR involves phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha and activation of NF-kappa B. In this way, expression of different genes is regulated by PKR. Among the genes upregulated in response to PKR are Fas, Bax and p53. The pathway of PKR-induced apoptosis involves FADD activation of caspase 8 by a mechanism independent of Fas and TNFR. Since IFNs are used as drugs for different disorders such as viral infection and cancer, understanding the pathway of apoptosis induction triggered by PKR should be useful in the rational design of IFN therapies.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of interferons (IFNs), considerable progress has been made in describing the nature of the cytokines themselves, the signalling components that direct the cell response and their antiviral activities. Gene targeting studies have distinguished four main effector pathways of the IFN-mediated antiviral response: the Mx GTPase pathway, the 2',5'-oligoadenylate-synthetase-directed ribonuclease L pathway, the protein kinase R pathway and the ISG15 ubiquitin-like pathway. As discussed in this Review, these effector pathways individually block viral transcription, degrade viral RNA, inhibit translation and modify protein function to control all steps of viral replication. Ongoing research continues to expose additional activities for these effector proteins and has revealed unanticipated functions of the antiviral response.},

abstract = {CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are considered to be critical mediators for resistance to influenza virus infection. We have previously demonstrated that dendritic cells are potent antigen presenting cells in the development of anti-influenza CTLs. Here we identify distinctive features of the interaction of influenza virus with dendritic cells. Exposure of dendritic cells to influenza virus at MOIs of 2–4:1 leads to \&gt;90\% infection, as manifested by the expression of the viral proteins HA and NS1. The infection is non-toxic as viral protein expression is sustained for \&gt;2 days with retention of viablility, but little infectious virus is produced. Substantial induction of the anti-viral cytokine IFN-$\alpha$ also occurs. Influenza infection of macrophages also results in viral protein expression in a majority of cells, and synthesis of IFN-$\alpha$. In contrast to dendritic cells, macrophages display evidence of apoptosis within 10–12 hours, and the majority of cells die within 24–36 hours. During this interval macrophages synthesize \&gt;10-fold higher levels of virus than dendritic cells. Infected dendritic cells but not macrophages, can induce substantial CTL responses from purified blood CD8+ T cells in the absence of exogenous cytokines such as IL-2. Low levels of infection (MOIs of 0.02) are sufficient to generate potent CTL responses. Influenza virus expressing non-cleaved HA does not elicit CTLs indicating that virus must access the cytoplasm of dendritic cells to utilize traditional class I processing pathways. These observations indicate that DCs are distinct in their handling of influenza virus and for the induction of anti-viral immunity.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and members of the proinflammatory interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) family are dependent on the presence of MyD88 for efficient signal transduction. The bipartite nature of MyD88 (N-terminal death domain [DD] and COOH-terminal Toll/IL-1 receptor [TIR] domain) allows it to link the TIR domain of IL-1R/TLR with the DD of the Ser/Thr kinase termed IL-1R–associated kinase (IRAK)-1. This triggers IRAK-1 phosphorylation and in turn the activation of multiple signaling cascades such as activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-$\kappa$B. In contrast, expression of MyD88 short (MyD88s), an alternatively spliced form of MyD88 that lacks only the short intermediate domain separating the DD and TIR domains, leads to a shutdown of IL-1/lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-$\kappa$B activation. Here, we provide the molecular explanation for this difference. MyD88 but not MyD88s strongly interacts with IRAK-4, a newly identified kinase essential for IL-1R/TLR signaling. In the presence of MyD88s, IRAK-1 is not phosphorylated and neither activates NF-$\kappa$B nor is ubiquitinated. Thus, MyD88s acts as a negative regulator of IL-1R/TLR/MyD88-triggered signals, leading to a transcriptionally controlled negative regulation of innate immune responses. },

Three classes of receptors, designated retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), sense viral components, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA, and DNA. RLRs and TLRs play essential roles in the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines in cell type-specific manners. While the RLRs play essential roles in the recognition of RNA viruses in various cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells utilize TLRs for detecting virus invasion. NLRs play a role in the production of mature interleukin-1 beta to dsRNA stimulation. Activation of innate immune cells is critical for mounting adaptive immune responses.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been shown to mediate the recognition of many types of pathogens, including viruses. The genomes of viruses possess unique characteristics that are not found in mammalian genomes, such as high CpG content and double-stranded RNA. These genomic nucleic acids serve as molecular signatures associated with viral infections. Here we show that TLR7 recognizes the single-stranded RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus. The recognition of these viruses by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells through TLR7 results in their activation of costimulatory molecules and production of cytokines. Moreover, this recognition required intact endocytic pathways. Mice deficient in either the TLR7 or the TLR adaptor protein MyD88 demonstrated reduced responses to in vivo infection with vesicular stomatitis virus. These results demonstrate microbial ligand recognition by TLR7 and provide insights into the pathways used by the innate immune cells in the recognition of viral pathogens.},

Expression of ISG15 (UCRP), a ubiquitin-like protein, and protein ISGylation are highly increased upon viral infection. We have identified UBP43 (USP18) as an ISG15 deconjugating protease. Protein ISGylation is enhanced in cells deficient in UBP43 (ref. 6). Here we have examined the role of UBP43, encoded by the gene Usp18, in innate immunity to virus infection. Usp18(-/-) mice were resistant to the fatal lymphocytic choriomeningitis and myeloencephalitis that developed in wild-type mice after intracerebral inoculation with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), respectively. Survival of Usp18(-/-) mice after intracerebral LCMV infection correlated with a severe inhibition of LCMV RNA replication and antigen expression in the brain and increased levels of protein ISGylation. Consistent with these findings, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and bone marrow-derived macrophages from Usp18(-/-) mice showed restricted LCMV replication. Moreover, MEF from Usp18(-/-) mice showed enhanced interferon-mediated resistance to the cytopathic effect caused by VSV and Sindbis virus (SNV). This report provides the first direct evidence that the ISG15 protease UBP43 and possibly protein ISGylation have a role in innate immunity against viral infection.},

abstract = {Incubation of reticulocyte lysates or isolated crude ribosomes with low levels of double-stranded RNA (0.1-10 ng/ml) induces the formation of an inhibitor of protein synthesis initiation similar to that observed in heme deficiency. The inhibitor is associated with a cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activity (ATP:protein phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.37) that phosphorylates the small polypeptide (38,000 daltons) of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2. Activation of the inhibitor requires ATP in addition to double-stranded RNA and is accompanied by the phosphorylation of a 67,000-dalton polypeptide of unknown function. The inhibitor remains associated with the ribosomes during high-speed sedimentation. Once formed, the ribosome-associated inhibitor phosphorylates eIF-2 and inhibits protein synthesis in the absence of double-stranded RNA. Inhibition is prevented by exogenous eIF-2. The bound inhibitor can be solubilized by extraction with 0.5 M KCl. The soluble inhibitor preparation retains the ability to phosphorylate the small polypeptide of eIF-2 and to inhibit protein synthesis. Untreated crude ribosomes also contain cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activities that phosphorylate the middle polypeptide (49,000 daltons) of eIF-2 and several polypeptide subunits of eIF-3 (160,000, 125,000, and 65,000 daltons); these kinase activities are not affected by double-stranded RNA and do not inhibit protein synthesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated the roles of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in naturally occurring influenza. METHODS: A prospective, case - control study was conducted. Adults hospitalized with virologically confirmed influenza A infections (onset <48 hours, before treatment) were compared with age-/gender-matched controls. TLRs (2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9) expression in monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs - total, myeloid, plasmacytoid) was quantitated using flow cytometry. Gene expression of RLRs (RIG-1, MDA-5) was evaluated using real-time PCR. Concomitant signaling molecules expression, plasma cytokine/chemokine concentrations, and respiratory tract viral loads were measured. PBMCs were cultured and stimulated ex vivo with TLR-specific ligands for cytokine responses. RESULTS: Forty two patients with influenza (24 A/H3N2, 18 A/H1N1pdm09) and 20 controls were studied. Patients' mean age was 68 +/- 16 years; 81\% had respiratory/cardiovascular complications. There were increased cellular expressions of TLR9, TLR8, TLR3, and TLR7 during influenza; TLR2 and TLR4 were suppressed. Results were similar for both virus strains. Higher TLR expression levels at presentation significantly correlated with lower viral loads (Spearman's rho: -0.46 to -0.69 for TLR9, TLR8, and TLR3; P-values <0.05). Multivariate regression models (adjusted for age, comorbidity, disease severity, time from onset) confirmed their independent associations. Increased signaling molecules (phospho-MAPKs, IkappaB) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, sTNFR-1, CCL2/MCP-1; CXCL10/IP-10, IFN-gamma) correlated with increased TLR expression. RLRs were upregulated simultaneously. PBMCs of patients with influenza showed significant, dynamic changes in their cytokine responses upon TLR stimulation, compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TLRs play an important role in early, innate viral inhibition in naturally occurring influenza. Inflammatory cytokine responses are concomitantly induced. These findings support investigation of TLR targeting as a novel intervention approach for prophylaxis against influenza.},

abstract = {The mammalian protein kinase PKR is a critical component of the innate immune response against virus infection. Its cellular actions are mediated by modulating cell signaling and translational regulation. To be enzymatically active, latent PKR needs to be activated by binding to one of its activators, dsRNA or PACT protein. Although the structures of the N-terminal dsRNA-binding domain and the C-terminal kinase domain of PKR have been separately determined, the mode of activation of the enzyme remains unknown. To address this problem, we used biochemical, genetic, and NMR analyses to identify the PACT-binding motif (PBM) located in the kinase domain and demonstrated an intramolecular interaction between PBM and dsRNA-binding domain. This interaction is responsible for keeping PKR in an inactive conformation, because its disruption by point mutations of appropriate residues produced constitutively active PKR. Furthermore, a short decoy peptide, representing PBM, was able to activate PKR by interfering with the intramolecular interaction. These observations suggest a model for PKR activation upon binding of dsRNA or PACT.},

abstract = {Apoptosis is a major form of cell death, characterized initially by a series of stereotypic morphological changes. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the gene ced-3 encodes a protein required for developmental cell death. Since the recognition that CED-3 has sequence identity with the mammalian cysteine protease interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE), a family of at least 10 related cysteine proteases has been identified. These proteins are characterized by almost absolute specificity for aspartic acid in the P1 position. All the caspases (ICE-like proteases) contain a conserved QACXG (where X is R, Q or G) pentapeptide active-site motif. Capases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes comprising an N-terminal peptide (prodomain) together with one large and one small subunit. The crystal structures of both caspase-1 and caspase-3 show that the active enzyme is a heterotetramer, containing two small and two large subunits. Activation of caspases during apoptosis results in the cleavage of critical cellular substrates, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamins, so precipitating the dramatic morphological changes of apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by CD95 (Fas/APO-1) and tumour necrosis factor activates caspase-8 (MACH/FLICE/Mch5), which contains an N-terminus with FADD (Fas-associating protein with death domain)-like death effector domains, so providing a direct link between cell death receptors and the caspases. The importance of caspase prodomains in the regulation of apoptosis is further highlighted by the recognition of adapter molecules, such as RAIDD [receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-associated ICH-1/CED-3-homologous protein with a death domain]/CRADD (caspase and RIP adapter with death domain), which binds to the prodomain of caspase-2 and recruits it to the signalling complex.

abstract = {Induced sputum is a readily accessible biological fluid whose composition may alter as a consequence of disease. To date, however, the proteins that routinely populate this biofluid are largely unknown, in part due to the technical difficulties in processing such mucin-rich samples. To provide a catalogue of sputum proteins, we have surveyed the proteome of human-induced sputum (sputome). A combination of 2-D gel analysis and GeLC-MS/MS allowed a total of 191 human proteins to be confidently assigned. In addition to the expected components, several hitherto unreported proteins were found to be present, including three members of the annexin family, kallikreins 1 and 11, and peroxiredoxins 1, 2 and 5. Other sets of proteins identified included four proteins previously annotated as hypothetical or conserved hypothetical. Taken together, these data represent the first extensive survey of the proteome of induced sputum and provide a platform for future identification of biomarkers of lung disease.},

abstract = {The cellular DEAD box RNA helicase UAP56 plays a pivotal role in the efficient transcription/replication of influenza A virus. UAP56 is recruited by the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A viruses, and recent data revealed that the RNA helicase is required for the nuclear export of a subset of spliced and unspliced viral mRNAs. The fact that influenza viruses do not produce detectable amounts of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates during transcription/replication suggests the involvement of cellular RNA helicases. Hence, we examined whether the RNA-unwinding activity of UAP56 or its paralog URH49 plays a role in preventing the accumulation of dsRNA during infection. First, our data showed that not only UAP56 but also its paralog URH49 can interact with NPs of avian and human influenza A viruses. The small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of either RNA helicase reduced the transport of M1 and hemagglutinin (HA) mRNAs and, to a lesser extent, NP and NS1 mRNAs into the cytoplasm. Moreover, we found that virus infection of UAP56-depleted cells leads to the rapid accumulation of dsRNA in the perinuclear region. In parallel, we observed a robust virus-mediated activation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), indicating that the cellular RNA helicase UAP56 may be recruited by influenza virus to prevent dsRNA formation. The accumulation of dsRNA was blocked when actinomycin D or cycloheximide was used to inhibit viral transcription/replication or translation, respectively. In summary, we demonstrate that UAP56 is utilized by influenza A viruses to prevent the formation of dsRNA and, hence, the activation of the innate immune response.},

Although produced rapidly in response to pathogens, IFNs are also produced at low levels in the absence of infection. In the present study, we demonstrate that constitutively produced IFNs are necessary in vivo to maintain dendritic cells in an "Ag presentation-competent" state. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) isolated from spleens of IFN-beta or IFNAR-deficient mice exhibit a highly impaired ability to present Ag and activate naive T cells. Microarray analysis of mRNA isolated from IFN-beta(-/-) and IFNAR(-/-) cDCs revealed diminished expression of two genes that encoded members of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family. Consistent with this observation, pharmacological inhibition of Hsp70 in cDCs from wild-type mice impaired their T cell stimulatory capacity. Similarly, the Ag presentation ability of splenic cDCs isolated from Hsp70.1/3(-/-) mice was also severely impaired in comparison to wild-type cDCs. Thus, constitutive IFN-beta expression regulates Hsp70 levels to help maintain dendritic cells in a competent state for efficient priming of effector T cells in vivo.},

Three closely positioned genes on human chromosome 19 encode distinct but paralogous proteins, which we designate interferon-lambda1 (IFN-lambda1), IFN-lambda2 and IFN-lambda3 (tentatively designated as IL-29, IL-28A and IL-28B, respectively, by HUGO). The expression of IFN-lambda mRNAs was inducible by viral infection in several cell lines. We identified a distinct receptor complex that is utilized by all three IFN-lambda proteins for signaling and is composed of two subunits, a receptor designated CRF2-12 (also designated as IFN-lambdaR1) and a second subunit, CRF2-4 (also known as IL-10R2). Both receptor chains are constitutively expressed on a wide variety of human cell lines and tissues and signal through the Jak-STAT (Janus kinases-signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway. This receptor-ligand system may contribute to antiviral or other defenses by a mechanism similar to, but independent of, type I IFNs.},

Two classes of IFN-inducible nuclear factors were found that bind to the ISRE. The most rapidly induced factor appeared without new protein synthesis, whereas a second factor required active protein synthesis for its appearance and maintenance. The kinetics of appearance and loss of these binding activities correlate with the activation and repression of IFN-stimulated genes. These different IFN-activated or induced factors may bind sequentially to the same essential promoter element to first increase and then repress transcription.},

NecroX-5 reduced the increase of mitochondrial ROS generation in airway inflammatory cells, as well as bronchial epithelial cells, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-[kappa]B, increased expression of various inflammatory mediators and pathophysiological features of allergic asthma in mice. Finally, blockade of IL-1[beta] substantially reduced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in the asthmatic mice. These findings suggest that mitochondrial ROS have a critical role in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation through the modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, providing a novel role of airway epithelial cells expressing NLRP3 inflammasome as an immune responder.},

abstract = {In previous studies, we observed that the virulent avian influenza A virus A/Turkey/Ontario/7732/66 (Ty/Ont) induced severe lymphoid depletion in vivo and rapidly killed an avian lymphocyte cell line (RP9) in vitro. In examining the mechanism of cell killing by this virus, we found that Ty/Ont induced fragmentation of the RP9 cellular DNA into a 200-bp ladder and caused ultrastructural changes characteristic of apoptotic cell death by 5 h after infection. We next determined that the ability to induce apoptosis was not unique to Ty/Ont. In fact, a variety of influenza A viruses (avian, equine, swine, and human), as well as human influenza B viruses, induced DNA fragmentation in a permissive mammalian cell line, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), and this correlated with the development of a cytopathic effect during viral infection. Since the proto-oncogene bcl-2 is a known inhibitor of apoptosis, we transfected MDCK cells with the human bcl-2 gene; these stably transfected cells (MDCKbcl-2) did not undergo DNA fragmentation after virus infection. In addition, cytotoxicity assays at 48 to 72 h after virus infection showed a high level of cell viability for MDCKbcl-2 compared with a markedly lower level of viability for MDCK cells. These studies indicate that influenza A and B viruses induce apoptosis in cell cultures; thus, apoptosis may represent a general mechanism of cell death in hosts infected with influenza viruses.},

abstract = {Influenza A is a highly contagious single-stranded RNA virus that infects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of humans. The host innate immune Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 was shown previously in cells of myeloid origin to recognize the viral replicative, intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Thus, dsRNA may be critical for the outcome of the infection. Here we first compared the activation triggered by either influenza A virus or dsRNA in pulmonary epithelial cells. We established that TLR3 is constitutively expressed in human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells, and we describe its intracellular localization. Expression of TLR3 was positively regulated by the influenza A virus and by dsRNA but not by other inflammatory mediators, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide, the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta, and the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. We also demonstrated that TLR3 contributes directly to the immune response of respiratory epithelial cells to influenza A virus and dsRNA, and we propose a molecular mechanism by which these stimuli induce epithelial cell activation. This model involves mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling, and the TLR3-associated adaptor molecule TRIF but not MyD88-dependent activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB or interferon regulatory factor/interferon-sensitive response-element pathways. Ultimately, this signal transduction elicits an epithelial response that includes the secretion of the cytokines IL-8, IL-6, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), and interferon-beta and the up-regulation of the major adhesion molecule ICAM-1.},

To overcome the innate antiviral response, RNA viruses encode suppressors of IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$ induction, which block RLRs recognition of dsRNA by means of different mechanisms that can be categorized into: (i) dsRNA binding and/or shielding ("hide"), (ii) dsRNA termini processing ("mask") and (iii) direct interaction with components of the RLRs pathway ("hit"). In light of recent functional, biochemical and structural findings, we review the inhibition mechanisms of RLRs recognition of dsRNA displayed by a number of highly pathogenic RNA viruses with different disease phenotypes such as haemorrhagic fever (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, Lujo, Machupo, Junin, Guanarito, Crimean-Congo, Rift Valley fever, dengue), severe respiratory disease (influenza, SARS, Hendra, Hantaan, Sin Nombre, Andes) and encephalitis (Nipah, West Nile). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Detection of 5'-triphosphate RNA is abrogated by capping of the 5'-triphosphate end or by nucleoside modification of RNA, both occurring during posttranscriptional RNA processing in eukaryotes. Genomic RNA prepared from a negative-strand RNA virus and RNA prepared from virus-infected cells (but not from noninfected cells) triggered a potent interferon-alpha response in a phosphatase-sensitive manner. 5'-triphosphate RNA directly binds to RIG-I. Thus, uncapped 5'-triphosphate RNA (now termed 3pRNA) present in viruses known to be recognized by RIG-I, but absent in viruses known to be detected by MDA-5 such as the picornaviruses, serves as the molecular signature for the detection of viral infection by RIG-I.},

abstract = {Influenza viruses cause annual outbreaks of respiratory tract infection with attack rates of 5–10\%. This means that humans are infected repeatedly with intervals of, on average, 10–20 years. Upon each infection subjects develop innate and adaptive immune responses which aim at clearing the infection. Strain-specific antibody responses are induced, which exert selective pressure on circulating influenza viruses and which drive antigenic drift of seasonal influenza viruses, especially in the hemagglutinin molecule. This antigenic drift necessitates updating of seasonal influenza vaccines regularly in order to match the circulating strains. Upon infection also virus-specific T cell responses are induced, including CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. These cells are mainly directed to conserved proteins and therefore display cross-reactivity with a variety of influenza A viruses of different subtypes. T cell mediated immunity therefore may contribute to so-called heterosubtypic immunity and may afford protection against antigenically distinct, potentially pandemic influenza viruses. At present, novel viral targets are identified that may help to develop broad-protective vaccines. Here we review the various arms of the immune response to influenza virus infections and their viral targets and discuss the possibility of developing universal vaccines. The development of such novel vaccines would imply that also new immune correlates of protection need to be established in order to facilitate assessment of vaccine efficacy.},
