abstract = {The epidemiology of virus infections has changed dramatically in Europe in recent years due to ecologic, anthropologic and biologic factors such as: i) climate modifications, ii) global exchange of goods and international travel, iii) increased immigration flux from Africa, South America, the Middle East and Asia, iv) reduction of cultivated areas, and v) emergence and re-emergence of human viruses from zoonotic reservoirs. In addition, recent technical advancements have allowed the identification of previously unrecognized autochthonous viral species. Thus, at present, the technical and cultural challenge is to recognize infections caused by viruses not normally circulating in our geographical region (both as imported cases or potential local outbreaks), sustained by recently discovered autochthonous viruses or due to recognized viruses which are no longer widespread in Western Europe due to past vaccination campaigns. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

@article{Esposito2014,
abstract = {Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are members of the large and growing family of Picornaviridae. Although 16 types have been described on the basis of the phylogenetic analyses of the VP1 encoding region, the majority of published reports relate to the HPeV types 1-8. In pediatrics, HPeV1, HPeV2 and HPeV4-8 mainly cause mild gastrointestinal or respiratory illness; only occasionally more serious diseases have been reported, including myocarditis, encephalitis, pneumonia, meningitis, flaccid paralysis, Reye syndrome and fatal neonatal infection. In contrast, HPeV3 causes severe illness in young infants, including sepsis and conditions involving the central nervous system. Currently, the most sensitive method for detecting HPeV is real-time polymerase chain reaction assays on stools, respiratory swabs, blood and cerebrospinal fluid. However, although it is known that HPeVs play a significant role in various severe pediatric infectious diseases, diagnostic assays are not routinely available in clinical practice and the involvement of HPeV is therefore substantially underestimated. Despite long-term efforts, the development of antiviral therapy against HPeVs is limited; no antiviral medication is available and the use of monoclonal antibodies is still being evaluated. More research is therefore needed to clarify the specific characteristics of this relevant group of viruses and to develop appropriate treatment strategies. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are members of the large and growing family of Picornaviridae. Although originally described as echovirus 22 and 23 within human enteroviruses because of their clinical and morphological properties, they have since been shown to be distinct from this and other picornavirus groups in several features of their genome organisation, structure and replication. Human parechoviruses show genetic and antigenic heterogeneity and a number of distinct HPeV types are known to circulate widely in human populations throughout the world. Although the majority of HPeV infections occur early in life without specific symptoms, disease manifestations associated with many of the currently described types have been described, ranging from gastroenteritis and respiratory infections to neurological disease, particularly in neonates. Although HPeV diagnosis has historically been made by virus isolation, a new generation of sensitive and specific molecular tests for HPeV RNA promises to greatly improve the effectiveness of HPeV detection and type identification, as well as providing a greater understanding its molecular epidemiology. By this means, we will learn much more about the clinical relevance of HPeVs and the association of different HPeV types with specific disease presentations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Westerhuis2012,
abstract = {Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are picornaviruses frequently infecting humans. While HPeV1 is associated with mild disease, HPeV3 is the cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. To test whether in vitro replication kinetics of HPeV1 and HPeV3 could be related to pathogenicity, HPeV1 and HPeV3 strains isolated from patients were cultured on cell lines of gastrointestinal, respiratory and neural origin, and replication kinetics were measured by real-time PCR. No relationship was found between clinical symptoms and in vitro replication of the HPeV1 strains. In contrast, the HPeV3 strains showed faster replication in neural cells and there was a relationship between higher in vitro replication kinetics and neuropathogenicity in the patient. Furthermore, HPeV1 could be neutralized efficiently by its specific antibody and by intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), while most HPeV3 strains could not be neutralized. In IVIG, very low neutralizing antibody (nAb) titres against HPeV3 were found. Additionally, very low nAb titres were observed in sera of two HPeV3-infected donors, while high nAb titres against HPeV1 could be detected. Our data suggest that the mild clinical course of HPeV1 infection is primarily influenced by strong nAb responses, while HPeV3 might be difficult to neutralize in vivo and therefore the course of infection will mainly be determined by in vivo cell tropism.},
