abstract = {Influenza A viruses contain genomes composed of eight separate segments of negative-sense RNA. Circulating human strains are notorious for their tendency to accumulate mutations from one year to the next and cause recurrent epidemics. However, the segmented nature of the genome also allows for the exchange of entire genes between different viral strains. The ability to manipulate influenza gene segments in various combinations in the laboratory has contributed to its being one of the best characterized viruses, and studies on influenza have provided key contributions toward the understanding of various aspects of virology in general. However, the genetic plasticity of influenza viruses also has serious potential implications regarding vaccine design, pathogenicity, and the capacity for novel viruses to emerge from natural reservoirs and cause global pandemics.},

@article{Ehrhardt2010,
abstract = {Pathogens such as influenza A viruses (IAV) have to overcome a number of barriers defined and maintained by the host, to successfully establish an infection. One of the initial barriers is collectively characterized as the innate immune system. This is a broad anti-pathogen defense program that ranges from the action of natural killer cells to the induction of an antiviral cytokine response. In this article we will focus on new developments and discoveries concerning the interaction of IAV with the cellular innate immune signaling. We discuss new mechanisms of interference of IAV with the pathogen recognition receptor RIG-I and the type I IFN antagonist NS1 in the background of already known and established concepts. Further we summarize progress related to recently identified IFN induced proteins and the role of RNA interference in the context of IAV infection. ?? 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

@article{Rossmann2002,
abstract = {Many picornaviruses use cell-surface molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) as their cellular receptors. These molecules usually consist of tandem repeats of between two and five Ig-like domains whose amino-terminal domains (D1) interact with invading viruses, with their carboxy-terminal sections comprising a transmembrane and a short cytoplasmic region. Most rhino- and enteroviruses, belonging to the Picornavirus family, use a canyon-like feature on their surface to attach to cellular receptors. Binding into the canyon destabilizes the virus and thus initiates the uncoating process. By contrast, non-IgSF molecules, when used by picornaviruses as receptors, bind outside the canyon and do not cause viral instability.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of interferons (IFNs), considerable progress has been made in describing the nature of the cytokines themselves, the signalling components that direct the cell response and their antiviral activities. Gene targeting studies have distinguished four main effector pathways of the IFN-mediated antiviral response: the Mx GTPase pathway, the 2',5'-oligoadenylate-synthetase-directed ribonuclease L pathway, the protein kinase R pathway and the ISG15 ubiquitin-like pathway. As discussed in this Review, these effector pathways individually block viral transcription, degrade viral RNA, inhibit translation and modify protein function to control all steps of viral replication. Ongoing research continues to expose additional activities for these effector proteins and has revealed unanticipated functions of the antiviral response.},

abstract = {Influenza viruses are a major pathogen of both humans and animals. Recent studies using gene-knockout mice have led to an in-depth understanding of the innate sensors that detect influenza virus infection in a variety of cell types. Signalling downstream of these sensors induces distinct sets of effector mechanisms that block virus replication and promote viral clearance by inducing innate and adaptive immune responses. In this Review, we discuss the various ways in which the innate immune system uses pattern recognition receptors to detect and respond to influenza virus infection. We consider whether the outcome of innate sensor stimulation promotes antiviral resistance or disease tolerance, and propose rational treatment strategies for the acute respiratory disease that is caused by influenza virus infection.},

@article{Marc2014,
abstract = {Most viruses express one or several proteins that counter the anti-viral defences of the host-cell. This is the task of non-structural protein NS1 in influenza viruses. Absent from the viral particle but highly expressed in the infected cell, NS1 dramatically inhibits the cellular gene expression and prevents the activation of key players in the interferon system. In addition, NS1 selectively enhances the translation of viral mRNAs and may regulate the synthesis of viral RNAs. Our knowledge of the virus and of its protein NS1 has dramatically increased during the last fifteen years. The atomic structure of NS1 has been determined, many cellular partners were identified and its multiple activities have been studied in depth. This review presents our current knowledge and attempts to establish relationships between the RNA sequence, the structure of the protein, its ligands, its activities and the pathogenicity of the virus. A better knowledge of NS1 could help in elaborating novel antiviral strategies, based on either live vaccines with altered NS1, or on small-compounds inhibitors of NS1.},

@article{Yanguez2011,
abstract = {Influenza virus is included among the Orthomyxoviridae family and it is a major public health problem causing annual mortality worldwide. Viral mRNAs bear short capped oligonucleotide sequences at their 5â€²-ends, acquired from host cell pre-mRNAs during viral transcription, and are polyadenylated at their 3â€²-end. Therefore, viral and cellular mRNAs are undistinguishable from a structural point of view. However, selective translation of viral proteins occurs upon infection, while initiation and elongation steps of cellular mRNA translation are efficiently inhibited. Viruses do not possess the complex machinery required to translate their mRNAs and are then obliged to compete for host-cell factors and manipulate the translation apparatus to their own benefit. Thus, the understanding of the processes that govern viral translation could facilitate the finding of possible targets for anti viral interventions. In the present review, we will point out the mechanisms by which influenza virus takes control of the host-cell protein synthesis machinery to ensure the production of new viral particles. First, we will discuss the mechanisms by which the virus counteracts the anti viral translation repression induced in the infected cell. Next, we will focus on the shut-off of cellular protein synthesis and the specific requirements for the eIF4F complex on influenza mRNA translation. Finally, we will discuss the role of different cellular and viral proteins in the selective translation of viral messengers in the infected cell and we will summarize the proposed mechanisms for the recruitment of cellular translational machinery to the viral mRNAs.

abstract = {Our understanding of picornavirus RNA replication has improved over the past 10 years, due in large part to the discovery of cis-active RNA elements (CREs) within picornavirus RNA genomes. CREs function as templates for the conversion of VPg, the Viral Protein of the genome, into VPgpUpUOH. These so called CREs are different from the previously recognized cis-active RNA sequences and structures within the 5??? and 3??? NTRs of picornavirus genomes. Two adenosine residues in the loop of the CRE RNA structures allow the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3DPol to add two uridine residues to the tyrosine residue of VPg. Because VPg and/or VPgpUpUOH prime the initiation of viral RNA replication, the asymmetric replication of viral RNA could not be explained without an understanding of the viral RNA template involved in the conversion of VPg into VPgpUpUOH primers. We review the growing body of knowledge regarding picornavirus CREs and discuss how CRE RNAs work coordinately with viral replication proteins and other cis-active RNAs in the 5??? and 3??? NTRs during RNA replication. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
