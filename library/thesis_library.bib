We here studied the cellular localization of several artificial proteins and found that the diffusion limit set by the nuclear pore is not as small as previously thought. The results indicate that the maximal size of protein to diffuse through the nuclear pore complex could be quite larger than 60 kDa, thus greatly extending the diffusion limit that the nuclear pore can accommodate.

abstract = {As invading viruses do not harbor functional ribosomes in their virions, successful amplification of the viral genomes requires that viral mRNAs compete with cellular mRNAs for the host cell translation apparatus. Several RNA viruses have evolved remarkable strategies to recruit the host translation initiation factors required for the first steps in translation initiation by host cell mRNAs. This review describes the ways that three families of RNA viruses effectively usurp limiting translation initiation factors from the host.},

abstract = {Selenoproteins are a family of proteins that share the common feature of containing selenocysteine, the "twenty-first" amino acid. Selenocysteine incorporation occurs during translation of selenoprotein messages by redefinition of UGA codons, which normally specify termination of translation. Studies of the eukaryotic selenocysteine incorporation mechanism suggest that selenocysteine insertion is inefficient compared with termination. Nevertheless, selenoprotein P and several other selenoproteins are known to contain multiple selenocysteines. The production of full-length (FL) protein from these messages would seem to demand highly efficient selenocysteine incorporation due to the compounding effect of termination at each UGA codon. We present data demonstrating that efficient incorporation of multiple selenocysteines can be reconstituted in rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions. Selenocysteine incorporation at the first UGA codon is inefficient but increases by approximately 10-fold at subsequent downstream UGA codons. We found that ribosomes in the "processive" phase of selenocysteine incorporation (i.e., after decoding the first UGA codon as selenocysteine) are fully competent to terminate translation at UAG and UAA codons, that ribosomes become less efficient at selenocysteine incorporation as the distance between UGA codons is increased, and that efficient selenocysteine incorporation is not dependent on cis-acting elements unique to selenoprotein P. Furthermore, we found that the percentage of ribosomes decoding a UGA codon as selenocysteine rather than termination can be increased by 3- to 5-fold by placing the murine leukemia virus UAG read-through element upstream of the first UGA codon or by providing a competing messenger RNA in trans. The mechanisms of selenocysteine incorporation and selenoprotein synthesis are discussed in light of these results.},

abstract = {The ML protein of Thogoto virus, a tick-transmitted orthomyxovirus, is a splice variant of the viral matrix protein and antagonizes the induction of antiviral type I interferon (IFN). Here we identified the general RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) as an ML-interacting protein. Overexpression of TFIIB neutralized the inhibitory effect of ML on IRF3-mediated promoter activation. Moreover, a recombinant virus expressing a mutant ML protein unable to bind TFIIB was severely impaired in its ability to suppress IFN induction. We concluded that TFIIB binding is required for the IFN antagonist effect exerted by ML. We further demonstrate that the ML-TFIIB interaction has surprisingly little impact on gene expression in general, while a strong negative effect is observed for IRF3- and NF-kappaB-regulated promoters.},

abstract = {The non-structural protein 1 of influenza virus (NS1) is a relatively small polypeptide with an outstanding number of ascribed functions. NS1 is the main viral antagonist of the innate immune response during influenza virus infection, chiefly by inhibiting the type I interferon system at multiple steps. As such, its role is critical to overcome the first barrier the host presents to halt the viral infection. However, the pro-viral activities of this well-studied protein go far beyond and include regulation of viral RNA and protein synthesis, and disruption of the host cell homeostasis by dramatically affecting general gene expression while tweaking the PI3K signaling network. Because of all of this, NS1 is a key virulence factor that impacts influenza pathogenesis, and adaptation to new hosts, making it an attractive target for control strategies. Here, we will overview the many roles that have been ascribed to the NS1 protein, and give insights into the sequence features and structural properties that make them possible, highlighting the need to understand how NS1 can actually perform all of these functions during viral infection.},

abstract = {The DeltaF508 mutation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a trafficking mutant, which is retained and degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The mutant protein fails to reach a completely folded conformation that is no longer a substrate for ubiquitination ("stable B"). Wild type protein reaches this state with 25\% efficiency. In this study the rabbit reticulocyte lysate with added microsomal membranes has been used to reproduce the post-translational events in the folding of wild type and DeltaF508 CFTR. In this system wild type CFTR does not reach the stable B form if the post-translational temperature is 37 degrees C, whereas at 30 degrees C the behavior of both wild type and mutant proteins mimics that observed in the cell. Geldanamycin stabilizes DeltaF508 CFTR with respect to ubiquitination only when added post-translationally. The interaction of wild type and mutant CFTR with the molecular chaperones heat shock cognate 70 (hsc70) and heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) has been assessed. Release of wild type protein from hsc70 coincides with the cessation of ubiquitination and formation of stable B. Geldanamycin immediately prevents the binding of hsp90 to DeltaF508 CFTR, and after a delay releases it from hsc70. Release of mutant protein from hsc70 also coincides with the formation of stable B DeltaF508 CFTR.},

Protein yields exceed grams protein produced per liter reaction volume, batch reactions last for multiple hours, costs have been reduced orders of magnitude, and reaction scale has reached the 100-liter milestone. These advances have inspired new applications in the synthesis of protein libraries for functional genomics and structural biology, the production of personalized medicines, and the expression of virus-like particles, among others. In the coming years, cell-free protein synthesis promises new industrial processes where short protein production timelines are crucial as well as innovative approaches to a wide range of applications.},

These events depended on the presence of cholesterol and on the activation of tyrosine kinases that phosphorylated proteins in caveolae. They were necessary for formation of caveolae-derived endocytic vesicles and for infection of the cell. Thus, caveolar endocytosis is ligand-triggered and involves extensive rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {A defining characteristic of eukaryotic cells is the possession of a nuclear envelope. Transport of macromolecules between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments occurs through nuclear pore complexes that span the double membrane of this envelope. The molecular basis for transport has been revealed only within the last few years. The transport mechanism lacks motors and pumps and instead operates by a process of facilitated diffusion of soluble carrier proteins, in which vectoriality is provided by compartment-specific assembly and disassembly of cargo-carrier complexes. The carriers recognize localization signals on the cargo and can bind to pore proteins. They also bind a small GTPase, Ran, whose GTP-bound form is predominantly nuclear. Ran-GTP dissociates import carriers from their cargo and promotes the assembly of export carriers with cargo. The ongoing discovery of numerous carriers, Ran-independent transport mechanisms, and cofactors highlights the complexity of the nuclear transport process. Multiple regulatory mechanisms are also being identified that control cargo-carrier interactions. Circadian rhythms, cell cycle, transcription, RNA processing, and signal transduction are all regulated at the level of nucleocytoplasmic transport. This review focuses on recent discoveries in the field, with an emphasis on the carriers and cofactors involved in transport and on possible mechanisms for movement through the nuclear pores.},

Thus, viruses have acquired the capacity to subvert host cell apoptosis, control inflammatory responses, and evade immune reactions. Since the elimination of infected cells via programmed cell death is one of the most ancestral defense mechanisms against infection, disabling host cell apoptosis might represent an almost obligate step in the viral life cycle. Conversely, viruses may take advantage of stimulating apoptosis, either to kill uninfected cells from the immune system, or to induce the breakdown of infected cells, thereby favoring viral dissemination. Several viral polypeptides are homologs of host-derived apoptosis-regulatory proteins, such as members of the Bcl-2 family. Moreover, viral factors with no homology to host proteins specifically target key components of the apoptotic machinery. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the viral modulation of mitochondrial apoptosis, by focusing in particular on the mechanisms by which viral proteins control the host cell death apparatus.},

abstract = {Cell signaling in response to an array of diverse stress stimuli converges on the phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha on serine 51 results in a severe decline in de novo protein synthesis and is an important strategy in the cell's armory against stressful insults including viral infection, the accumulation of misfolded proteins, and starvation. The phosphorylation of eIF2alpha is carried out by a family of four kinases, PERK (PKR-like ER kinase), PKR (protein kinase double-stranded RNA-dependent), GCN2 (general control non-derepressible-2), and HRI (heme-regulated inhibitor). Each primarily responds to a distinct type of stress or stresses. Thus, while significant sequence similarity exists between the eIF2alpha kinases in their kinase domains, underlying their common role in phosphorylating eIF2alpha, additional unique features determine the regulation of these four proteins, that is, what signals activate them. This review will describe the structure of each eIF2alpha kinase and discuss how this is linked to their activation and function. In parallel to the general translational attenuation elicited by eIF2alpha kinase activation the translation of stress-induced mRNAs, most notably activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is enhanced and these set in motion cascades of gene expression constituting the integrated stress response (ISR), which seek to remediate stress and restore homeostasis. Depending on the cellular context and concurrent signaling pathways active, however, translational attenuation can also facilitate apoptosis. Accordingly, the role of the kinases in determining cell fate will also be discussed.},

Analysis of PABP integrity was carried out in BHK-21 (baby-hamster kidney) and COS-7 cells upon individual expression of the protease from several members of the Retroviridae family, e.g. MoMLV (Moloney murine leukaemia virus), MMTV (mouse mammary tumour virus), HTLV-I (human T-cell leukaemia virus type I), SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), HIV-1 and HIV-2. Moreover, protease activity against PABP was tested in a HeLa-cell-free system. Only MMTV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases were able to cleave PABP in the absence of other viral proteins. Purified HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases cleave PABP1 directly at positions 237 and 477, separating the two first RNA-recognition motifs from the C-terminal domain of PABP. An additional cleavage site located at position 410 was detected for HIV-2 protease. These findings indicate that some retroviruses may share with picornaviruses and caliciviruses the capacity to proteolyse PABP.},

abstract = {The TATA-binding protein (TBP) plays a crucial role in cellular transcription catalyzed by all three DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Previous studies have shown that TBP is targeted by the poliovirus (PV)-encoded protease 3C(pro) to bring about shutoff of cellular RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in PV-infected cells. The processing of the majority of viral precursor proteins by 3C(pro) involves cleavages at glutamine-glycine (Q-G) sites. We present evidence that suggests that the transcriptional inactivation of TBP by 3C(pro) involves cleavage at the glutamine 104-serine 105 (Q104-S105) site of TBP and not at the Q18-G19 site as previously thought. The TBP Q104-S105 cleavage by 3C(pro) is greatly influenced by the presence of an aliphatic amino acid at the P4 position, a hallmark of 3C(pro)-mediated proteolysis. To examine the importance of host cell transcription shutoff in the PV life cycle, stable HeLa cell lines were created that express recombinant TBP resistant to cleavage by the viral proteases, called GG rTBP. Transcription shutoff was significantly impaired and delayed in GG rTBP cells upon infection with poliovirus compared with the cells that express wild-type recombinant TBP (wt rTBP). Infection of GG rTBP cells with poliovirus resulted in small plaques, significantly reduced viral RNA synthesis, and lower viral yields compared to the wt rTBP cell line. These results suggest that a defect in transcription shutoff can lead to inefficient replication of poliovirus in cultured cells.},

Dendritic cells (DCs) and phagocytes produce IL-12 in response to pathogens during infection. Production of IL-12 is dependent on differential mechanisms of regulation of expression of the genes encoding IL-12, patterns of Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression and cross-regulation between the different DC subsets, involving cytokines such as IL-10 and type I IFN. Recent data, however, argue against an absolute requirement for IL-12 for T(H)1 responses. Our understanding of the relative roles of IL-12 and other factors in T(H)1-type maturation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is discussed here, including the participation in this process of IL-23 and IL-27, two recently discovered members of the new family of heterodimeric cytokines.},

Bacterial protein production combined with protein refolding and purification is a conventional procedure to obtain active neurotrophic factors; however, the procedure is time consuming and appropriate protein refolding in vitro is sometimes unpredictable. Here we examined three distinct cell-free translation systems: reticulocyte lysate, Hela cell lysate and wheat germ extract, which may allow us to produce biologically active factors in a single tube. Taking type-I neuregulin-1 beta3 as an example, we produced neuregulin-1 protein from its mRNAs flanked by Cap nucleotide and/or internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and compared the yields and biological activity of translation products from these systems. The protein yield from IRES+ mRNA was highest in the Hela cell-free system, while background translation was lowest in the wheat germ system. The biological activity of both translation products was modest or negligible, however. Neuregulin-1 protein was produced in reticulocyte lysate at yields of 19 pmol/mL (\~{}500 ng/mL); furthermore, it was potent at phosphorylating ErbB4 receptor and able to bind to heparin sulfate. These results demonstrate that the reticulocyte lysate translation system produces active neurotrophic factors in vitro and is useful for radiolabeling or preliminary assessment of novel neurotrophic factors and their variants.},

abstract = {Initiation is the primary target of translational control for all organisms. Regulation of eukaryotic translation is traditionally thought to occur through initiation factors and RNA structures. Here, we characterize a transcript-specific translation initiation mechanism that is mediated by the ribosome. By studying vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), we identify the large ribosomal subunit protein rpL40 as requisite for VSV cap-dependent translation but not bulk cellular or internal ribosome entry site-driven translation. This requirement is conserved among members of the order Mononegavirales, including measles virus and rabies virus. Polysome analyses and in vitro reconstitution of initiation demonstrate that rpL40 is required for 80S formation on VSV mRNAs through a cis-regulatory element. Using deep sequencing, we further uncover a subset of cellular transcripts that are selectively sensitive to rpL40 depletion, suggesting VSV may have usurped an endogenous translation pathway. Together, these findings demonstrate that the ribosome acts as a translational regulator outside of its catalytic role during protein synthesis.},

abstract = {1. Osmotic shock disrupts particles of phage T2 into material containing nearly all the phage sulfur in a form precipitable by antiphage serum, and capable of specific adsorption to bacteria. It releases into solution nearly all the phage DNA in a form not precipitable by antiserum and not adsorbable to bacteria. The sulfur-containing protein of the phage particle evidently makes up a membrane that protects the phage DNA from DNase, comprises the sole or principal antigenic material, and is responsible for attachment of the virus to bacteria. 2. Adsorption of T2 to heat-killed bacteria, and heating or alternate freezing and thawing of infected cells, sensitize the DNA of the adsorbed phage to DNase. These treatments have little or no sensitizing effect on unadsorbed phage. Neither heating nor freezing and thawing releases the phage DNA from infected cells, although other cell constituents can be extracted by these methods. These facts suggest that the phage DNA forms part of an organized intracellular structure throughout the period of phage growth. 3. Adsorption of phage T2 to bacterial debris causes part of the phage DNA to appear in solution, leaving the phage sulfur attached to the debris. Another part of the phage DNA, corresponding roughly to the remaining half of the DNA of the inactivated phage, remains attached to the debris but can be separated from it by DNase. Phage T4 behaves similarly, although the two phages can be shown to attach to different combining sites. The inactivation of phage by bacterial debris is evidently accompanied by the rupture of the viral membrane. 4. Suspensions of infected cells agitated in a Waring blendor release 75 per cent of the phage sulfur and only 15 per cent of the phage phosphorus to the solution as a result of the applied shearing force. The cells remain capable of yielding phage progeny. 5. The facts stated show that most of the phage sulfur remains at the cell surface and most of the phage DNA enters the cell on infection. Whether sulfur-free material other than DNA enters the cell has not been determined. The properties of the sulfur-containing residue identify it as essentially unchanged membranes of the phage particles. All types of evidence show that the passage of phage DNA into the cell occurs in non-nutrient medium under conditions in which other known steps in viral growth do not occur. 6. The phage progeny yielded by bacteria infected with phage labeled with radioactive sulfur contain less than 1 per cent of the parental radioactivity. The progeny of phage particles labeled with radioactive phosphorus contain 30 per cent or more of the parental phosphorus. 7. Phage inactivated by dilute formaldehyde is capable of adsorbing to bacteria, but does not release its DNA to the cell. This shows that the interaction between phage and bacterium resulting in release of the phage DNA from its protective membrane depends on labile components of the phage particle. By contrast, the components of the bacterium essential to this interaction are remarkably stable. The nature of the interaction is otherwise unknown. 8. The sulfur-containing protein of resting phage particles is confined to a protective coat that is responsible for the adsorption to bacteria, and functions as an instrument for the injection of the phage DNA into the cell. This protein probably has no function in the growth of intracellular phage. The DNA has some function. Further chemical inferences should not be drawn from the experiments presented.},

Viruses encounter common problems during their entry process into the host cells, and similar strategies seem to ensure, for example, that the movement toward the site of replication and the translocation through the host membrane occur. The penetration of the host cell's external envelope involves, across the viral world, either fusion between two membranes, channel formation through the host envelope, disruption of the membrane vesicle, or a combination of these events.

In the present work, cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII has been analyzed by employing the proteases encoded within the genomes of several members of the family Retroviridae, e.g., Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), mouse mammary tumor virus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus. All of the retroviral proteases examined were able to cleave the initiation factor eIF4GI both in intact cells and in cell-free systems, albeit with different efficiencies. The eIF4GI hydrolysis patterns obtained with HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases were very similar to each other but rather different from those obtained with MoMLV protease. Both eIF4GI and eIF4GII were cleaved very efficiently by the MoMLV protease. However, eIF4GII was a poor substrate for HIV proteases. Proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G led to a profound inhibition of cap-dependent translation, while protein synthesis driven by mRNAs containing internal ribosome entry site elements remained unaffected or was even stimulated in transfected cells.},

After membrane fusion, the virus spontaneously "uncoated" with diffusion of the viral membrane proteins into the host plasma membrane and a merging of the host and viral membranes. This led to deposit of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and interior proteins in the cell cytoplasm. Later work showed that the common procedure then used to grow Sendai virus produced damaged, pleomorphic virions. Virions, which were grown under conditions that were not damaging, made a connecting structure between virus and cell at the region where the fusion occurred. The virus did not release its membrane proteins into the host membrane. The viral RNP was seen in the connecting structure in some cases. Uncoating of intact Sendai virus proceeds differently from uncoating described by the current standard model developed long ago with damaged virus.

CHMP2A and CHMP4B proteins bound one another, and this interaction was required for budding. By contrast, virus release was reduced only modestly by depletion of CHMP3 and CHMP1 proteins (2- to 8-fold titer reductions) and was unaffected by depletion of other human ESCRT-III proteins.

abstract = {No matter what their origin, strain and family, viruses have evolved exquisite strategies to reach and penetrate specific target cells where they hijack the cellular machinery to express viral genes and produce progeny particles. The ability to deliver and express genetic information to cells is the basis for exploiting viruses as "Trojan horses" to genetically modify the natural cell target or, upon manipulation of the viral receptor to retarget the virus, to genetically engineer different cell types. This process, known as transduction, is accomplished using viral vectors derived from parental wild type viruses whose viral genes, essential for replication and virulence, have been replaced with the heterologous gene(s) required for cell manipulation. Rearrangement of the viral genome to impede replication or generation of infectious virions but maintaining the ability to deliver nucleic acids has been the object of intense research since the early 1980s. Technological advances and the ever-growing knowledge of molecular virology and virus-host cell relationships have constantly improved the safety profile of viral vectors that are now used in vitro and in vivo to study cellular gene function, correct genetic defects (gene therapy), express therapeutic proteins, vaccinate against infectious agents and tumors, produce experimental animal models, and for other purposes.

abstract = {Virus entry is initiated by recognition by receptors present on the surface of host cells. Receptors can be major mediators of virus tropism, and in many cases receptor interactions occur in an apparently programmed series of events utilizing multiple receptors. After receptor interaction, both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses must deliver their genome across either the endosomal or plasma membrane for infection to proceed. Genome delivery occurs either by membrane fusion (in the case of enveloped viruses) or by pore formation or other means of permeabilizing the lipid bilayer (in the case of nonenveloped viruses). For those viruses that enter cells via endosomes, specific receptor interactions (and the signaling events that ensue) may control the particular route of endocytosis and/or the ultimate destination of the incoming virus particles. Our conception of virus entry is increasingly becoming more complex; however, the specificity involved in entry processes, once ascertained, may ultimately lead to the production of effective antiviral agents.},

Cell-free translation is central to the ribosome display process and is performed in such a way that the ribosome provides the link between genotype and phenotype that allows genes encoding proteins with desired properties to be identified by selection. Prokaryotic cell-free translation reagents, based initially on E. coli cell extracts and more recently containing purified and recombinant factors, have dominated the ribosome display literature. Eukaryotic cell extracts are also suitable for ribosome display; however, protocols for prokaryotic ribosome display are not directly transferable to the use of eukaryotic cell extracts.

abstract = {The current paradigm for managing infectious diseases has targeted unique processes or enzymes within pathogens. A serious disadvantage of this pathogen-directed drug targeting strategy has been the development of microbial drug resistance and consequent resurgence of once-contained infectious diseases. A new drug discovery paradigm has therefore emerged focusing on identifying and targeting host factors essential for pathogen entry, survival, and replication. Innovative strategies combining genome-wide computational biology, genomics, proteomics, and traditional forward and reverse genetics have identified host-pathogen interactions and host functions critical for the establishment of infection. Chemogenomics and chemical genetics have allowed rapid identification of new and existing licensed drugs with antimicrobial activity. Although most host-directed drug targeting studies have focused on viral infections, they have provided a proof of concept for similar approaches to bacterial and parasite infections. Future therapies may combine conventional targeting of microbial virulence factors, together with host-directed drug therapy and augmentation of protective host factors, to efficiently eliminate the invading pathogen.},

A key activator of lytic infection is a virion protein called VP16, which, upon infection of a permissive cell, forms a transcriptional regulatory complex with two cellular proteins - the POU-domain transcription factor Oct-1 and the cell-proliferation factor HCF-1 - to activate transcription of the first set of expressed viral genes. This regulatory complex, called the VP16-induced complex, reveals mechanisms of combinatorial control of transcription. The activities of Oct-1 and HCF-1 - two important regulators of cellular gene expression and proliferation - illuminate strategies by which HSV might coexist with its host.},

Classical genetic approaches for studying the role of PKR in cell signaling have their limitations due to overlapping but non-redundant pathways. Small molecule inhibitors of PKR will be useful in this regard. We report here, the discovery of a small molecule inhibitor of the kinase reaction of PKR. The inhibitor was discovered by screening a library of 26 different ATP-binding site directed inhibitors of varying structure. We also describe the development of a high-throughput assay for screening a large number of compounds for a PKR inhibitor using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and luciferase mRNA. The assay takes advantage of the fact that the reticulocyte lysate is rich in components of the translational machinery, of which PKR is an integral part. This assay can be carried out with added exogenous human PKR to study the effect of various compounds in their ability to rescue the translational block imposed by human PKR.},

abstract = {Many enveloped viruses complete their replication cycle by forming vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane. Some viruses encode "late" (L) domain motifs that are able to hijack host proteins involved in the vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) pathway, a cellular budding process that gives rise to multivesicular bodies and that is topologically equivalent to virus budding. Although many enveloped viruses share this mechanism, examples of viruses that require additional viral factors and viruses that appear to be independent of the VPS pathway have been identified. Alternative mechanisms for virus budding could involve other topologically similar process such as cell abscission, which occurs following cytokinesis, or virus budding could proceed spontaneously as a result of lipid microdomain accumulation of viral proteins. Further examination of novel virus-host protein interactions and characterization of other enveloped viruses for which budding requirements are currently unknown will lead to a better understanding of the cellular processes involved in virus assembly and budding.

abstract = {Translation initiation is a complex process in which initiator tRNA, 40S, and 60S ribosomal subunits are assembled by eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) into an 80S ribosome at the initiation codon of mRNA. The cap-binding complex eIF4F and the factors eIF4A and eIF4B are required for binding of 43S complexes (comprising a 40S subunit, eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNAi and eIF3) to the 5' end of capped mRNA but are not sufficient to promote ribosomal scanning to the initiation codon. eIF1A enhances the ability of eIF1 to dissociate aberrantly assembled complexes from mRNA, and these factors synergistically mediate 48S complex assembly at the initiation codon. Joining of 48S complexes to 60S subunits to form 80S ribosomes requires eIF5B, which has an essential ribosome-dependent GTPase activity and hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP induced by eIF5. Initiation on a few mRNAs is cap-independent and occurs instead by internal ribosomal entry. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and hepatitis C virus epitomize distinct mechanisms of internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated initiation. The eIF4A and eIF4G subunits of eIF4F bind immediately upstream of the EMCV initiation codon and promote binding of 43S complexes. EMCV initiation does not involve scanning and does not require eIF1, eIF1A, and the eIF4E subunit of eIF4F. Initiation on some EMCV-like IRESs requires additional noncanonical initiation factors, which alter IRES conformation and promote binding of eIF4A/4G. Initiation on the hepatitis C virus IRES is even simpler: 43S complexes containing only eIF2 and eIF3 bind directly to the initiation codon as a result of specific interaction of the IRES and the 40S subunit.},

Using yeast two hybrid system, recombinant technology, and confocal microscopy, we further demonstrated that the nonstructural viral NSs protein interacts with the p44 component of TFIIH to form nuclear filamentous structures that also contain XPB subunit of TFIIH. By competing with XPD, the natural partner of p44 within TFIIH, and sequestering p44 and XPB subunits, NSs prevents the assembly of TFIIH subunits, thus destabilizing the normal host cell life. These observations shed light on the mechanism utilized by RVFV to evade the host response.},

abstract = {Assembly of negative-strand RNA viruses occurs by budding from host plasma membranes. The budding process involves association of the viral core or nucleocapsid with a region of cellular membrane that will become the virus budding site, which contains the envelope glycoproteins and matrix protein. This region of membrane then buds out and pinches off to become the virus envelope. This review will address the questions of what are the mechanisms that bring the nucleocapsid and envelope glycoproteins together to form the virus budding site, and how does this lead to release of progeny virions? Recent evidence supports the idea that viral envelope glycoproteins and matrix proteins are organized into membrane microdomains that coalesce to form virus budding sites. There has also been substantial progress in understanding the last step in virus release, referred to as the "late budding function," which often involves host proteins of the vacuolar protein sorting apparatus. Key questions are raised as to the mechanism of the initial steps in formation of virus budding sites: How are membrane microdomains brought together and how are nucleocapsids selected for incorporation into these budding sites, particularly in the case of viruses for which genome RNA sequences are important for envelopment of nucleocapsids? ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Oncolytic adenoviruses, such as Delta-24-RGD, are promising therapies for patients with brain tumor. Clinical trials have shown that the potency of these cancer-selective adenoviruses should be increased to optimize therapeutic efficacy. One potential strategy is to increase the efficiency of adenovirus-induced cell lysis, a mechanism that has not been clearly described. In this study, for the first time, we report that autophagy plays a role in adenovirus-induced cell lysis. At the late stage after adenovirus infection, numerous autophagic vacuoles accompany the disruption of cellular structure, leading to cell lysis. The virus induces a complete autophagic process from autophagosome initiation to its turnover through fusion with the lysosome although the formation of the autophagosome is sufficient for virally induced cell lysis. Importantly, downmodulation of autophagy genes (ATG5 or ATG10) rescues the infected cells from being lysed by the virus. Moreover, autophagy triggers caspase activity via the extrinsic FADD/caspase 8 pathway, which also contributes to adenovirus-mediated cell lysis. Therefore, our study implicates autophagy and caspase activation as part of the mechanism for cell lysis induced by adenovirus and suggests that manipulation of the process is a potential strategy to optimize clinical efficacy of oncolytic adenoviruses.},

This review describes strategies to overcome this obstacle developed by seven virus families: herpesviridae, adenoviridae, orthomyxoviridae, lentiviruses (which are part of retroviridae), Hepadnaviridae, parvoviridae and polyomaviridae. Most viruses use the canonical nuclear pore complex (NPC) in order to get their genome into the nucleus. Viral capsids that are larger than the nuclear pore disassemble before or during passing through the NPC, thus allowing genome nuclear entry. Surprisingly, increasing evidence suggest that parvoviruses and polyomaviruses may bypass the nuclear pore by trafficking directly through the nuclear membrane. Additional studies are required for better understanding these processes. Since nuclear entry emerges as the limiting step in infection for many viruses, it may serve as an ideal target for antiviral drug development.},

abstract = {Host protein synthesis is inhibited in cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). It has been proposed that viral mRNAs are subjected to the same inhibition but are predominantly translated because of their abundance. To compare translation efficiencies of viral and host mRNAs during infection, we used an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter expressed from a recombinant virus or from the host nucleus in stably transfected cells. Translation efficiency of host-derived EGFP mRNA was reduced more than threefold at eight hours postinfection, while viral-derived mRNA was translated around sevenfold more efficiently than host-derived EGFP mRNA in VSV-infected cells. To test whether mRNAs transcribed in the cytoplasm are resistant to shutoff of translation during VSV infection, HeLa cells were infected with a recombinant simian virus 5 (rSV5) that expressed GFP. Cells were then superinfected with VSV or mock superinfected. GFP mRNA transcribed by rSV5 was not resistant to translation inhibition during superinfection with VSV, indicating that transcription in the cytoplasm is not sufficient for preventing translation inhibition. To determine if cis-acting sequences in untranslated regions (UTRs) were involved in preferential translation of VSV mRNAs, we constructed EGFP reporters with VSV or control UTRs and measured the translation efficiency in mock-infected and VSV-infected cells. The presence of VSV UTRs did not affect mRNA translation efficiency in mock- or VSV-infected cells, indicating that VSV mRNAs do not contain cis-acting sequences that influence translation. However, we found that when EGFP mRNAs transcribed by VSV or by the host were translated in vitro, VSV-derived EGFP mRNA was translated 22 times more efficiently than host-derived EGFP mRNA. This indicated that VSV mRNAs do contain cis-acting structural elements (that are not sequence based), which enhance translation efficiency of viral mRNAs.},

RESULTS: Intranasal vaccination with the live replication-deficient delNS1-trivalent vaccine was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events. The most common adverse events identified, i.e. headache, oropharyngeal pain and rhinitis-like symptoms, were mainly mild and transient and distributed similarly in the treatment and placebo groups. Significant vaccine-specific immune responses were induced. Pre-existing low antibody titers or seronegativity for the corresponding vaccine strain yielded better response rates. CONCLUSIONS: We show that vaccination with a replication-deficient trivalent influenza vaccine containing H1N1, H3N2 and B strains lacking NS1 is safe and induces significant levels of antibodies (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01369862).},
