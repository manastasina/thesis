abstract = {Host protein synthesis is inhibited in cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). It has been proposed that viral mRNAs are subjected to the same inhibition but are predominantly translated because of their abundance. To compare translation efficiencies of viral and host mRNAs during infection, we used an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter expressed from a recombinant virus or from the host nucleus in stably transfected cells. Translation efficiency of host-derived EGFP mRNA was reduced more than threefold at eight hours postinfection, while viral-derived mRNA was translated around sevenfold more efficiently than host-derived EGFP mRNA in VSV-infected cells. To test whether mRNAs transcribed in the cytoplasm are resistant to shutoff of translation during VSV infection, HeLa cells were infected with a recombinant simian virus 5 (rSV5) that expressed GFP. Cells were then superinfected with VSV or mock superinfected. GFP mRNA transcribed by rSV5 was not resistant to translation inhibition during superinfection with VSV, indicating that transcription in the cytoplasm is not sufficient for preventing translation inhibition. To determine if cis-acting sequences in untranslated regions (UTRs) were involved in preferential translation of VSV mRNAs, we constructed EGFP reporters with VSV or control UTRs and measured the translation efficiency in mock-infected and VSV-infected cells. The presence of VSV UTRs did not affect mRNA translation efficiency in mock- or VSV-infected cells, indicating that VSV mRNAs do not contain cis-acting sequences that influence translation. However, we found that when EGFP mRNAs transcribed by VSV or by the host were translated in vitro, VSV-derived EGFP mRNA was translated 22 times more efficiently than host-derived EGFP mRNA. This indicated that VSV mRNAs do contain cis-acting structural elements (that are not sequence based), which enhance translation efficiency of viral mRNAs.},

abstract = {Initiation is the primary target of translational control for all organisms. Regulation of eukaryotic translation is traditionally thought to occur through initiation factors and RNA structures. Here, we characterize a transcript-specific translation initiation mechanism that is mediated by the ribosome. By studying vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), we identify the large ribosomal subunit protein rpL40 as requisite for VSV cap-dependent translation but not bulk cellular or internal ribosome entry site-driven translation. This requirement is conserved among members of the order Mononegavirales, including measles virus and rabies virus. Polysome analyses and in vitro reconstitution of initiation demonstrate that rpL40 is required for 80S formation on VSV mRNAs through a cis-regulatory element. Using deep sequencing, we further uncover a subset of cellular transcripts that are selectively sensitive to rpL40 depletion, suggesting VSV may have usurped an endogenous translation pathway. Together, these findings demonstrate that the ribosome acts as a translational regulator outside of its catalytic role during protein synthesis.},

abstract = {Viruses occur throughout the biosphere. Cells of Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea are infected by a variety of viruses that considerably outnumber the host cells. Although viruses have adapted to different host systems during evolution and many different viral strategies have developed, certain similarities can be found. Viruses encounter common problems during their entry process into the host cells, and similar strategies seem to ensure, for example, that the movement toward the site of replication and the translocation through the host membrane occur. The penetration of the host cell's external envelope involves, across the viral world, either fusion between two membranes, channel formation through the host envelope, disruption of the membrane vesicle, or a combination of these events. Endocytic-type events may occur during the entry of a bacterial virus as well as during the entry of an animal virus; the same applies for membrane fusion.},

Here we identified the general RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) as an ML-interacting protein. Overexpression of TFIIB neutralized the inhibitory effect of ML on IRF3-mediated promoter activation. Moreover, a recombinant virus expressing a mutant ML protein unable to bind TFIIB was severely impaired in its ability to suppress IFN induction. We concluded that TFIIB binding is required for the IFN antagonist effect exerted by ML. We further demonstrate that the ML-TFIIB interaction has surprisingly little impact on gene expression in general, while a strong negative effect is observed for IRF3- and NF-kappaB-regulated promoters.},

In picornaviruses, as well as in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), cleavage of eIF4G by the viral protease leads to inhibition of protein synthesis directed by capped cellular mRNAs. In the present work, cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII has been analyzed by employing the proteases encoded within the genomes of several members of the family Retroviridae, e.g., Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), mouse mammary tumor virus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus. All of the retroviral proteases examined were able to cleave the initiation factor eIF4GI both in intact cells and in cell-free systems, albeit with different efficiencies. The eIF4GI hydrolysis patterns obtained with HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases were very similar to each other but rather different from those obtained with MoMLV protease. Both eIF4GI and eIF4GII were cleaved very efficiently by the MoMLV protease. However, eIF4GII was a poor substrate for HIV proteases. Proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G led to a profound inhibition of cap-dependent translation, while protein synthesis driven by mRNAs containing internal ribosome entry site elements remained unaffected or was even stimulated in transfected cells.},

A hallmark of filovirus infection is the depletion of non-infected lymphocytes; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to the observed bystander lymphocyte apoptosis are poorly understood. Also, there is limited knowledge about the fate of infected cells in filovirus disease. In this review we will explore what is known about the intracellular events leading to virus amplification and cell damage in filovirus infection.

abstract = {A defining characteristic of eukaryotic cells is the possession of a nuclear envelope. Transport of macromolecules between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments occurs through nuclear pore complexes that span the double membrane of this envelope. The molecular basis for transport has been revealed only within the last few years. The transport mechanism lacks motors and pumps and instead operates by a process of facilitated diffusion of soluble carrier proteins, in which vectoriality is provided by compartment-specific assembly and disassembly of cargo-carrier complexes. The carriers recognize localization signals on the cargo and can bind to pore proteins. They also bind a small GTPase, Ran, whose GTP-bound form is predominantly nuclear. Ran-GTP dissociates import carriers from their cargo and promotes the assembly of export carriers with cargo. The ongoing discovery of numerous carriers, Ran-independent transport mechanisms, and cofactors highlights the complexity of the nuclear transport process. Multiple regulatory mechanisms are also being identified that control cargo-carrier interactions. Circadian rhythms, cell cycle, transcription, RNA processing, and signal transduction are all regulated at the level of nucleocytoplasmic transport. This review focuses on recent discoveries in the field, with an emphasis on the carriers and cofactors involved in transport and on possible mechanisms for movement through the nuclear pores.},

abstract = {The TATA-binding protein (TBP) plays a crucial role in cellular transcription catalyzed by all three DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Previous studies have shown that TBP is targeted by the poliovirus (PV)-encoded protease 3C(pro) to bring about shutoff of cellular RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in PV-infected cells. The processing of the majority of viral precursor proteins by 3C(pro) involves cleavages at glutamine-glycine (Q-G) sites. We present evidence that suggests that the transcriptional inactivation of TBP by 3C(pro) involves cleavage at the glutamine 104-serine 105 (Q104-S105) site of TBP and not at the Q18-G19 site as previously thought. The TBP Q104-S105 cleavage by 3C(pro) is greatly influenced by the presence of an aliphatic amino acid at the P4 position, a hallmark of 3C(pro)-mediated proteolysis. To examine the importance of host cell transcription shutoff in the PV life cycle, stable HeLa cell lines were created that express recombinant TBP resistant to cleavage by the viral proteases, called GG rTBP. Transcription shutoff was significantly impaired and delayed in GG rTBP cells upon infection with poliovirus compared with the cells that express wild-type recombinant TBP (wt rTBP). Infection of GG rTBP cells with poliovirus resulted in small plaques, significantly reduced viral RNA synthesis, and lower viral yields compared to the wt rTBP cell line. These results suggest that a defect in transcription shutoff can lead to inefficient replication of poliovirus in cultured cells.},

Although many enveloped viruses share this mechanism, examples of viruses that require additional viral factors and viruses that appear to be independent of the VPS pathway have been identified. Alternative mechanisms for virus budding could involve other topologically similar process such as cell abscission, which occurs following cytokinesis, or virus budding could proceed spontaneously as a result of lipid microdomain accumulation of viral proteins. Further examination of novel virus-host protein interactions and characterization of other enveloped viruses for which budding requirements are currently unknown will lead to a better understanding of the cellular processes involved in virus assembly and budding.

We report that infection of MT-2 cells with HIV-1 leads to efficient proteolysis of PABP. Analysis of PABP integrity was carried out in BHK-21 (baby-hamster kidney) and COS-7 cells upon individual expression of the protease from several members of the Retroviridae family, e.g. MoMLV (Moloney murine leukaemia virus), MMTV (mouse mammary tumour virus), HTLV-I (human T-cell leukaemia virus type I), SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), HIV-1 and HIV-2. Moreover, protease activity against PABP was tested in a HeLa-cell-free system. Only MMTV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases were able to cleave PABP in the absence of other viral proteins. Purified HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases cleave PABP1 directly at positions 237 and 477, separating the two first RNA-recognition motifs from the C-terminal domain of PABP. An additional cleavage site located at position 410 was detected for HIV-2 protease. These findings indicate that some retroviruses may share with picornaviruses and caliciviruses the capacity to proteolyse PABP.},

Using yeast two hybrid system, recombinant technology, and confocal microscopy, we further demonstrated that the nonstructural viral NSs protein interacts with the p44 component of TFIIH to form nuclear filamentous structures that also contain XPB subunit of TFIIH. By competing with XPD, the natural partner of p44 within TFIIH, and sequestering p44 and XPB subunits, NSs prevents the assembly of TFIIH subunits, thus destabilizing the normal host cell life. These observations shed light on the mechanism utilized by RVFV to evade the host response.},

Receptors can be major mediators of virus tropism, and in many cases receptor interactions occur in an apparently programmed series of events utilizing multiple receptors. After receptor interaction, both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses must deliver their genome across either the endosomal or plasma membrane for infection to proceed. Genome delivery occurs either by membrane fusion (in the case of enveloped viruses) or by pore formation or other means of permeabilizing the lipid bilayer (in the case of nonenveloped viruses). For those viruses that enter cells via endosomes, specific receptor interactions (and the signaling events that ensue) may control the particular route of endocytosis and/or the ultimate destination of the incoming virus particles. Our conception of virus entry is increasingly becoming more complex; however, the specificity involved in entry processes, once ascertained, may ultimately lead to the production of effective antiviral agents.},

Here, we review recent studies in the field that have advanced our knowledge of the structure and function of this expanding family of viral proteins.},

abstract = {When herpes simplex virus (HSV) infects human cells, it is able to enter two modes of infection: lytic and latent. A key activator of lytic infection is a virion protein called VP16, which, upon infection of a permissive cell, forms a transcriptional regulatory complex with two cellular proteins - the POU-domain transcription factor Oct-1 and the cell-proliferation factor HCF-1 - to activate transcription of the first set of expressed viral genes. This regulatory complex, called the VP16-induced complex, reveals mechanisms of combinatorial control of transcription. The activities of Oct-1 and HCF-1 - two important regulators of cellular gene expression and proliferation - illuminate strategies by which HSV might coexist with its host.},

abstract = {The highly pathogenic filoviruses, Marburg and Ebola virus, are difficult to handle and knowledge of the interactions between filoviruses and their host cells remained enigmatic for many years. Two developments were crucial for the presented advances in our understanding of the cell biology of filoviruses, which is still fragmentary. On the one hand, the number of high containment laboratories increased where handling of the highly pathogenic filoviruses is possible. On the other hand, molecular biological tools have been developed that allow investigation of certain aspects of filoviral replication under normal laboratory conditions which considerably accelerated research on filoviruses. This review describes advances in understanding the interactions between host cells and filoviruses during viral attachment, entry, transcription, assembly and budding.},
