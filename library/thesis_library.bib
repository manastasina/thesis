abstract = {Viruses occur throughout the biosphere. Cells of Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea are infected by a variety of viruses that considerably outnumber the host cells. Although viruses have adapted to different host systems during evolution and many different viral strategies have developed, certain similarities can be found. Viruses encounter common problems during their entry process into the host cells, and similar strategies seem to ensure, for example, that the movement toward the site of replication and the translocation through the host membrane occur. The penetration of the host cell's external envelope involves, across the viral world, either fusion between two membranes, channel formation through the host envelope, disruption of the membrane vesicle, or a combination of these events. Endocytic-type events may occur during the entry of a bacterial virus as well as during the entry of an animal virus; the same applies for membrane fusion.},

abstract = {Many enveloped viruses complete their replication cycle by forming vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane. Some viruses encode "late" (L) domain motifs that are able to hijack host proteins involved in the vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) pathway, a cellular budding process that gives rise to multivesicular bodies and that is topologically equivalent to virus budding. Although many enveloped viruses share this mechanism, examples of viruses that require additional viral factors and viruses that appear to be independent of the VPS pathway have been identified. Alternative mechanisms for virus budding could involve other topologically similar process such as cell abscission, which occurs following cytokinesis, or virus budding could proceed spontaneously as a result of lipid microdomain accumulation of viral proteins. Further examination of novel virus-host protein interactions and characterization of other enveloped viruses for which budding requirements are currently unknown will lead to a better understanding of the cellular processes involved in virus assembly and budding.

abstract = {Host protein synthesis is inhibited in cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). It has been proposed that viral mRNAs are subjected to the same inhibition but are predominantly translated because of their abundance. To compare translation efficiencies of viral and host mRNAs during infection, we used an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter expressed from a recombinant virus or from the host nucleus in stably transfected cells. Translation efficiency of host-derived EGFP mRNA was reduced more than threefold at eight hours postinfection, while viral-derived mRNA was translated around sevenfold more efficiently than host-derived EGFP mRNA in VSV-infected cells. To test whether mRNAs transcribed in the cytoplasm are resistant to shutoff of translation during VSV infection, HeLa cells were infected with a recombinant simian virus 5 (rSV5) that expressed GFP. Cells were then superinfected with VSV or mock superinfected. GFP mRNA transcribed by rSV5 was not resistant to translation inhibition during superinfection with VSV, indicating that transcription in the cytoplasm is not sufficient for preventing translation inhibition. To determine if cis-acting sequences in untranslated regions (UTRs) were involved in preferential translation of VSV mRNAs, we constructed EGFP reporters with VSV or control UTRs and measured the translation efficiency in mock-infected and VSV-infected cells. The presence of VSV UTRs did not affect mRNA translation efficiency in mock- or VSV-infected cells, indicating that VSV mRNAs do not contain cis-acting sequences that influence translation. However, we found that when EGFP mRNAs transcribed by VSV or by the host were translated in vitro, VSV-derived EGFP mRNA was translated 22 times more efficiently than host-derived EGFP mRNA. This indicated that VSV mRNAs do contain cis-acting structural elements (that are not sequence based), which enhance translation efficiency of viral mRNAs.},

abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses remain a significant health threat to humans given the continued rare occurrence of human cases with a high case fatality rate. This brief literature review summarizes available evidence of risk factors for H5N1 infection in humans and updates a recent systematic review published in early 2011. Several epidemiologic studies have been published to evaluate the risk factors for H5N1 infection in humans, including contact with poultry and poultry products and non-poultry-related contact such as from H5N1-contaminated water. While most H5N1 cases are attributed to exposure to sick poultry, it is unclear how many may be due to human-to-human transmission. The collective results of published literature suggest that transmission risk of H5N1 from poultry to humans may be highest among individuals who may have been in contact with the highest potential concentrations of virus shed by poultry. This suggests that there may be a threshold of virus concentration needed for effective transmission and that circulating H5N1 strains have not yet mutated to transmit readily from either poultry to human or from human to human. However, the mode of potential transmission can be quite varied throughout different countries and by study with exposures ranging from visiting a wet market, preparing infected poultry for consumption, to swimming or bathing in ponds frequented by poultry. Several important data gaps remain in the understanding of the epidemiology of H5N1 in humans and limit our ability to interpret the results of the available H5N1 seroepidemiologic studies.},

abstract = {The PABP [poly(A)-binding protein] is able to interact with the 3' poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNA, promoting its translation. Cleavage of PABP by viral proteases encoded by several picornaviruses and caliciviruses plays a role in the abrogation of cellular protein synthesis. We report that infection of MT-2 cells with HIV-1 leads to efficient proteolysis of PABP. Analysis of PABP integrity was carried out in BHK-21 (baby-hamster kidney) and COS-7 cells upon individual expression of the protease from several members of the Retroviridae family, e.g. MoMLV (Moloney murine leukaemia virus), MMTV (mouse mammary tumour virus), HTLV-I (human T-cell leukaemia virus type I), SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), HIV-1 and HIV-2. Moreover, protease activity against PABP was tested in a HeLa-cell-free system. Only MMTV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases were able to cleave PABP in the absence of other viral proteins. Purified HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases cleave PABP1 directly at positions 237 and 477, separating the two first RNA-recognition motifs from the C-terminal domain of PABP. An additional cleavage site located at position 410 was detected for HIV-2 protease. These findings indicate that some retroviruses may share with picornaviruses and caliciviruses the capacity to proteolyse PABP.},

A key activator of lytic infection is a virion protein called VP16, which, upon infection of a permissive cell, forms a transcriptional regulatory complex with two cellular proteins - the POU-domain transcription factor Oct-1 and the cell-proliferation factor HCF-1 - to activate transcription of the first set of expressed viral genes. This regulatory complex, called the VP16-induced complex, reveals mechanisms of combinatorial control of transcription. The activities of Oct-1 and HCF-1 - two important regulators of cellular gene expression and proliferation - illuminate strategies by which HSV might coexist with its host.},

abstract = {Avian influenza (AI) virus is one of the most important diseases of the poultry industry around the world. The virus has a broad host range in birds and mammals, although the natural reservoir is wild birds where it typically causes an asymptomatic to mild infection. The virus in poultry can cause a range of clinical diseases and is defined either as low pathogenic AI (LPAI) or highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) depending on the type of disease it causes in chickens. Viruses that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces and cause mild disease with low mortality are termed LPAI. Viruses that replicate on mucosal surfaces and systemically and cause severe disease with a mortality rate of 75\% or greater in experimentally infected chickens are referred to as HPAI. A virus that is highly pathogenic in chickens may infect but result in a completely different disease and replication pattern in other host species. Outbreaks of HPAI have been relatively uncommon around the world in the last 50 years and have had limited spread within a country or region with one major exception, Asian lineage H5N1 that was first identified in 1996. This lineage of virus has spread to over 60 countries and has become endemic in poultry in at least four countries. AI virus also represents a public health threat, with some infected humans having severe disease and with a high case fatality rate. AI remains a difficult disease to control because of the highly infectious nature of the virus and the interface of domestic and wild animals. A better understanding of the disease and its transmission is important for control.},

Regulation of eukaryotic translation is traditionally thought to occur through initiation factors and RNA structures. Here, we characterize a transcript-specific translation initiation mechanism that is mediated by the ribosome. By studying vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), we identify the large ribosomal subunit protein rpL40 as requisite for VSV cap-dependent translation but not bulk cellular or internal ribosome entry site-driven translation. This requirement is conserved among members of the order Mononegavirales, including measles virus and rabies virus. Polysome analyses and in vitro reconstitution of initiation demonstrate that rpL40 is required for 80S formation on VSV mRNAs through a cis-regulatory element. Using deep sequencing, we further uncover a subset of cellular transcripts that are selectively sensitive to rpL40 depletion, suggesting VSV may have usurped an endogenous translation pathway. Together, these findings demonstrate that the ribosome acts as a translational regulator outside of its catalytic role during protein synthesis.},

Overexpression of TFIIB neutralized the inhibitory effect of ML on IRF3-mediated promoter activation. Moreover, a recombinant virus expressing a mutant ML protein unable to bind TFIIB was severely impaired in its ability to suppress IFN induction. We concluded that TFIIB binding is required for the IFN antagonist effect exerted by ML. We further demonstrate that the ML-TFIIB interaction has surprisingly little impact on gene expression in general, while a strong negative effect is observed for IRF3- and NF-kappaB-regulated promoters.},

abstract = {In this review we examine the hypothesis that aquatic birds are the primordial source of all influenza viruses in other species and study the ecological features that permit the perpetuation of influenza viruses in aquatic avian species. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of influenza A virus RNA segments coding for the spike proteins (HA, NA, and M2) and the internal proteins (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) from a wide range of hosts, geographical regions, and influenza A virus subtypes support the following conclusions. (i) Two partly overlapping reservoirs of influenza A viruses exist in migrating waterfowl and shorebirds throughout the world. These species harbor influenza viruses of all the known HA and NA subtypes. (ii) Influenza viruses have evolved into a number of host-specific lineages that are exemplified by the NP gene and include equine Prague/56, recent equine strains, classical swine and human strains, H13 gull strains, and all other avian strains. Other genes show similar patterns, but with extensive evidence of genetic reassortment. Geographical as well as host-specific lineages are evident. (iii) All of the influenza A viruses of mammalian sources originated from the avian gene pool, and it is possible that influenza B viruses also arose from the same source. (iv) The different virus lineages are predominantly host specific, but there are periodic exchanges of influenza virus genes or whole viruses between species, giving rise to pandemics of disease in humans, lower animals, and birds. (v) The influenza viruses currently circulating in humans and pigs in North America originated by transmission of all genes from the avian reservoir prior to the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic; some of the genes have subsequently been replaced by others from the influenza gene pool in birds. (vi) The influenza virus gene pool in aquatic birds of the world is probably perpetuated by low-level transmission within that species throughout the year. (vii) There is evidence that most new human pandemic strains and variants have originated in southern China. (viii) There is speculation that pigs may serve as the intermediate host in genetic exchange between influenza viruses in avian and humans, but experimental evidence is lacking. (ix) Once the ecological properties of influenza viruses are understood, it may be possible to interdict the introduction of new influenza viruses into humans.},

abstract = {The initiation factor eIF4G plays a central role in the regulation of translation. In picornaviruses, as well as in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), cleavage of eIF4G by the viral protease leads to inhibition of protein synthesis directed by capped cellular mRNAs. In the present work, cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII has been analyzed by employing the proteases encoded within the genomes of several members of the family Retroviridae, e.g., Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), mouse mammary tumor virus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus. All of the retroviral proteases examined were able to cleave the initiation factor eIF4GI both in intact cells and in cell-free systems, albeit with different efficiencies. The eIF4GI hydrolysis patterns obtained with HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases were very similar to each other but rather different from those obtained with MoMLV protease. Both eIF4GI and eIF4GII were cleaved very efficiently by the MoMLV protease. However, eIF4GII was a poor substrate for HIV proteases. Proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G led to a profound inhibition of cap-dependent translation, while protein synthesis driven by mRNAs containing internal ribosome entry site elements remained unaffected or was even stimulated in transfected cells.},

abstract = {The TATA-binding protein (TBP) plays a crucial role in cellular transcription catalyzed by all three DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Previous studies have shown that TBP is targeted by the poliovirus (PV)-encoded protease 3C(pro) to bring about shutoff of cellular RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in PV-infected cells. The processing of the majority of viral precursor proteins by 3C(pro) involves cleavages at glutamine-glycine (Q-G) sites. We present evidence that suggests that the transcriptional inactivation of TBP by 3C(pro) involves cleavage at the glutamine 104-serine 105 (Q104-S105) site of TBP and not at the Q18-G19 site as previously thought. The TBP Q104-S105 cleavage by 3C(pro) is greatly influenced by the presence of an aliphatic amino acid at the P4 position, a hallmark of 3C(pro)-mediated proteolysis. To examine the importance of host cell transcription shutoff in the PV life cycle, stable HeLa cell lines were created that express recombinant TBP resistant to cleavage by the viral proteases, called GG rTBP. Transcription shutoff was significantly impaired and delayed in GG rTBP cells upon infection with poliovirus compared with the cells that express wild-type recombinant TBP (wt rTBP). Infection of GG rTBP cells with poliovirus resulted in small plaques, significantly reduced viral RNA synthesis, and lower viral yields compared to the wt rTBP cell line. These results suggest that a defect in transcription shutoff can lead to inefficient replication of poliovirus in cultured cells.},

abstract = {Viroporins are small, hydrophobic proteins that are encoded by a wide range of clinically relevant animal viruses. When these proteins oligomerize in host cell membranes, they form hydrophilic pores that disrupt a number of physiological properties of the cell. Viroporins are crucial for viral pathogenicity owing to their involvement in several diverse steps of the viral life cycle. Thus, these viral proteins, which include influenza A virus matrix protein 2 (M2), HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) and hepatitis C virus p7, represent ideal targets for therapeutic intervention, and several compounds that block their pore-forming activity have been identified. Here, we review recent studies in the field that have advanced our knowledge of the structure and function of this expanding family of viral proteins.},

Pandemics are caused by viruses that contain a hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein to which human populations are immunologically naive. Such an HA can be introduced into the human population through reassortment between human and avian virus strains or through the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus to humans. The factors that determine the interspecies transmission and pathogenicity of influenza viruses are still poorly understood; however, the HA protein plays an important role in overcoming the interspecies barrier and in virulence in avian influenza viruses. Recently, the RNA polymerase (PB2) protein has also been recognized as a critical factor in host range restriction, while the nonstructural (NS1) protein affects the initial host immune responses. We summarize current knowledge of viral factors that determine host range restriction and pathogenicity of influenza A viruses.},

abstract = {The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is the causative agent of fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and acute hepatitis in ruminants. We found that infection by RVFV leads to a rapid and drastic suppression of host cellular RNA synthesis that parallels a decrease of the TFIIH transcription factor cellular concentration. Using yeast two hybrid system, recombinant technology, and confocal microscopy, we further demonstrated that the nonstructural viral NSs protein interacts with the p44 component of TFIIH to form nuclear filamentous structures that also contain XPB subunit of TFIIH. By competing with XPD, the natural partner of p44 within TFIIH, and sequestering p44 and XPB subunits, NSs prevents the assembly of TFIIH subunits, thus destabilizing the normal host cell life. These observations shed light on the mechanism utilized by RVFV to evade the host response.},

In this Review, we discuss recent crystallographic studies that provide molecular insights into HA-host receptor interactions that have enabled several influenza A virus subtypes to 'jump' from avian to human hosts.},

abstract = {Virus entry is initiated by recognition by receptors present on the surface of host cells. Receptors can be major mediators of virus tropism, and in many cases receptor interactions occur in an apparently programmed series of events utilizing multiple receptors. After receptor interaction, both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses must deliver their genome across either the endosomal or plasma membrane for infection to proceed. Genome delivery occurs either by membrane fusion (in the case of enveloped viruses) or by pore formation or other means of permeabilizing the lipid bilayer (in the case of nonenveloped viruses). For those viruses that enter cells via endosomes, specific receptor interactions (and the signaling events that ensue) may control the particular route of endocytosis and/or the ultimate destination of the incoming virus particles. Our conception of virus entry is increasingly becoming more complex; however, the specificity involved in entry processes, once ascertained, may ultimately lead to the production of effective antiviral agents.},

RNA from a victim of the 1918 pandemic was isolated from a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, lung tissue sample. Nine fragments of viral RNA were sequenced from the coding regions of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, matrix protein 1, and matrix protein 2.
