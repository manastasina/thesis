abstract = {BACKGROUND: Retinoic acid-inducible gene 1-like receptors (RLRs) are a novel family of pattern recognition receptors that include retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5), and laboratory of genomics and physiology 2 (LGP-2). The knowledge of RLRs and their function in the human airway is limited. This study explores the role of RLRs in the upper respiratory tract. METHODS: Tonsils, adenoids, nasal polyps, and biopsy specimens from the nasal mucosa were examined for the occurrence of the RIG-1, MDA-5, and LGP-2 using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line FaDu was cultured with the RIG-1/MDA-5 ligand poly(I:C)/LyoVec (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) and analyzed for cytokine release using ELISA. RESULTS: RIG-1, MDA-5, and LGP-2 mRNA were found in all tissues tested. The airway epithelium appeared to be their most prominent location. The RIG-1 and MDA-5 mRNA levels were higher in nasal polyps than in normal nasal mucosa, a state that seemed to be reversed by local steroid treatment. Culture of FaDu with poly(I:C)/LyoVec resulted in IL-6 and IL-8 release. No alteration in RLR expression in tonsils was seen on infection. CONCLUSION: This study shows the presence and functional activity of RLRs in the human upper airways. It also suggests a role for RLRs in nasal polyposis.},

abstract = {Retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I; also called DDX58) is a cytosolic viral RNA receptor that interacts with MAVS (also called VISA, IPS-1 or Cardif) to induce type I interferon-mediated host protective innate immunity against viral infection. Furthermore, members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, which contain a cluster of a RING-finger domain, a B box/coiled-coil domain and a SPRY domain, are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and antiviral activity. Here we report that the amino-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I undergo robust ubiquitination induced by TRIM25 in mammalian cells. The carboxy-terminal SPRY domain of TRIM25 interacts with the N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I; this interaction effectively delivers the Lys 63-linked ubiquitin moiety to the N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I, resulting in a marked increase in RIG-I downstream signalling activity. The Lys 172 residue of RIG-I is critical for efficient TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and for MAVS binding, as well as the ability of RIG-I to induce antiviral signal transduction. Furthermore, gene targeting demonstrates that TRIM25 is essential not only for RIG-I ubiquitination but also for RIG-I-mediated interferon- production and antiviral activity in response to RNA virus infection. Thus, we demonstrate that TRIM25 E3 ubiquitin ligase induces the Lys 63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, which is crucial for the cytosolic RIG-I signalling pathway to elicit host antiviral innate immunity.},

abstract = {Viral infection triggers host innate immune responses through activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF 3, which coordinately regulate the expression of type-I interferons such as interferon-beta (IFN-beta). Herein, we report the identification of a novel protein termed MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling), which mediates the activation of NF-kappaB and IRF 3 in response to viral infection. Silencing of MAVS expression through RNA interference abolishes the activation of NF-kappaB and IRF 3 by viruses, thereby permitting viral replication. Conversely, overexpression of MAVS induces the expression of IFN-beta through activation of NF-kappaB and IRF 3, thus boosting antiviral immunity. Epistasis experiments show that MAVS is required for the phosphorylation of IRF 3 and IkappaB and functions downstream of RIG-I, an intracellular receptor for viral RNA. MAVS contains an N-terminal CARD-like domain and a C-terminal transmembrane domain, both of which are essential for MAVS signaling. The transmembrane domain targets MAVS to the mitochondria, implicating a new role of mitochondria in innate immunity.},

abstract = {The cellular protein retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) senses intracellular viral infection and triggers a signal for innate antiviral responses including the production of type I IFN. RIG-I contains a domain that belongs to a DExD/H-box helicase family and exhibits an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) homology. There are three genes encoding RIG-I-related proteins in human and mouse genomes. Melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5), which consists of CARD and a helicase domain, functions as a positive regulator, similarly to RIG-I. Both proteins sense viral RNA with a helicase domain and transmit a signal downstream by CARD; thus, these proteins share overlapping functions. Another protein, LGP2, lacks the CARD homology and functions as a negative regulator by interfering with the recognition of viral RNA by RIG-I and MDA5. The nonstructural protein 3/4A protein of hepatitis C virus blocks the signaling by RIG-I and MDA5; however, the V protein of the Sendai virus selectively abrogates the MDA5 function. These results highlight ingenious mechanisms for initiating antiviral innate immune responses and the action of virus-encoded inhibitors.},

abstract = {The ATPase RIG-I senses viral RNAs that contain 5′-triphosphates in the cytoplasm. It initiates a signaling cascade that activates innate immune response by interferon and cytokine production, providing essential antiviral protection for the host. The mode of RNA 5′-triphosphate sensing by RIG-I remains elusive. We show that the C-terminal regulatory domain RD of RIG-I binds viral RNA in a 5′-triphosphate-dependent manner and activates the RIG-I ATPase by RNA-dependent dimerization. The crystal structure of RD reveals a zinc-binding domain that is structurally related to GDP/GTP exchange factors of Rab-like GTPases. The zinc coordination site is essential for RIG-I signaling and is also conserved in MDA5 and LGP2, suggesting related RD domains in all three enzymes. Structure-guided mutagenesis identifies a positively charged groove as likely 5′-triphosphate-binding site of RIG-I. This groove is distinct in MDA5 and LGP2, raising the possibility that RD confers ligand specificity. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

RIG-I is regulated by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, and three E3 ubiquitin ligases, RNF125, TRIM25, and Riplet, are reported to target RIG-I for ubiquitination. To examine the importance of Riplet in vivo, we generated Riplet-deficient mice. Fibroblasts, macrophages, and conventional dendritic cells from Riplet-deficient animals were defective for the production of IFN and other cytokines in response to infection with several RNA viruses. However, Riplet was dispensable for the production of IFN in response to B-DNA and DNA virus infection. Riplet deficiency abolished RIG-I activation during RNA virus infection, and the mutant mice were more susceptible to vesicular stomatitis virus infection than wild-type mice.

abstract = {RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene-I), a cytoplasmic RNA helicase, interacts with IPS-1/MAVS/Cardif/VISA, a protein on the outer membrane of mitochondria, to signal the presence of virus-derived RNA and induce type I interferon production. Activation of RIG-I requires the ubiquitin ligase, TRIM25, which mediates lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination of the RIG-I N-terminal CARD-like region. However, how this modification proceeds for activation of IPS-1 by RIG-I remains unclear. Here we identify an alternative factor, Riplet/RNF135, that promotes RIG-I activation independent of TRIM25. The Riplet/RNF135 protein consists of an N-terminal RING finger domain, C-terminal SPRY and PRY motifs, and shows sequence similarity to TRIM25. Immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that the C-terminal helicase and repressor domains of RIG-I interact with the Riplet/RNF135 C-terminal region, whereas the CARD-like region of RIG-I is dispensable for this interaction. Riplet/RNF135 promotes lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination of the C-terminal region of RIG-I, modification of which differs from the N-terminal ubiquitination by TRIM25. Overexpression and knockdown analyses revealed that Riplet/RNF135 promotes RIG-I-mediated interferon-beta promoter activation and inhibits propagation of the negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus. Our data suggest that Riplet/RNF135 is a novel factor of the RIG-I pathway that is involved in the evoking of human innate immunity against RNA virus infection, and activates RIG-I through ubiquitination of its C-terminal region. We infer that a variety of RIG-I-ubiquitinating molecular complexes sustain RIG-I activation to modulate RNA virus replication in the cytoplasm.},

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases (RLHs) are the two major receptor systems for detecting RNA viruses. The RLH signaling pathways play essential roles in the recognition of RNA viruses in various cells, with the exception of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which utilize TLRs for virus recognition. The route of infection determines the cell types responsible for type I IFN production. Recent studies have suggested that TLRs are critical for activation of adaptive immune responses against several virus infections, although it may be premature to draw such a conclusion for virus infections in general. In this review, we will discuss recent advances toward clarifying the signaling pathways activated by RLHs and TLRs.},

abstract = {Author SummaryThe cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor RIG-I recognizes various types of pathogenic viruses and evokes innate immune responses, whereas several viruses have evolved strategies to escape the host innate immune responses. RIG-I triggers a signal to induce type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines. RIG-I activation is regulated by K63-linked polyubiquitin chains mediated by the ubiquitin ligases TRIM25 and Riplet; however, the functional difference between the two ubiquitin ligases remains unclear, and the molecular mechanism underlying Riplet-mediated RIG-I activation is unknown. We revealed sequential roles of the two ubiquitin ligases during RIG-I activation and found that Riplet-mediated polyubiquitination of the RIG-I repressor domain released RIG-I autorepression of its N-terminal CARDs responsible for triggering the signal, which resulted in an association with TRIM25 ubiquitin ligase and TBK1 protein kinase. Interestingly, we found that this mechanism was targeted by hepatitis C virus, which is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. This result emphasizes the vital role of Riplet-mediated release of RIG-I RD autorepression in antiviral responses. Our results establish that Riplet releases RIG-I RD autorepression and demonstrated the biological significance of this mechanism in human innate immune responses.},

However, the relevance of helicase activity in the regulation of interferon production remains elusive. To examine the importance of the helicase domain function for these signaling proteins, a series of mutations targeting conserved helicase sequence motifs were analyzed for enzymatic activity, RNA binding, interferon induction, and antiviral signaling. Results indicate that all targeted motifs are required for ATP hydrolysis, but a subset is involved in RNA binding. The enzymatically inactive mutants differed in their signaling ability. Notably, mutations to MDA5 motifs I, III, and VI and RIG-I motif III produced helicase proteins with constitutive antiviral activity, whereas mutations in RIG-I motif V retained ATP hydrolysis but failed to mediate signal transduction. These findings demonstrate that type I interferon production mediated by full-length MDA5 and RIG-I is independent of the helicase domain catalytic activity. In addition, neither enzymatic activity nor RNA binding was required for negative regulation of antiviral signaling by LGP2, supporting an RNA-independent interference mechanism.},

Activation of RIG-I requires not only RNA but also polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 63 (K63) of ubiquitin. RIG-I binds specifically to K63-polyubiquitin chains through its tandem CARD domains in a manner that depends on RNA and ATP. Mutations in the CARD domains that abrogate ubiquitin binding also impair RIG-I activation. Remarkably, unanchored K63-ubiquitin chains, which are not conjugated to any target protein, potently activate RIG-I. These ubiquitin chains function as an endogenous ligand of RIG-I in human cells.

Each RLR senses different viral infections by recognizing replicating viral RNA in the cytoplasm. The RLR contains a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD), which is responsible for the binding specificity to the viral RNAs, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and 5'-triphosphated single-stranded RNA (5'ppp-ssRNA). Here, the solution structures of the MDA5 and LGP2 CTD domains were solved by NMR and compared with those of RIG-I CTD. The CTD domains each have a similar fold and a similar basic surface but there is the distinct structural feature of a RNA binding loop; The LGP2 and RIG-I CTD domains have a large basic surface, one bank of which is formed by the RNA binding loop. MDA5 also has a large basic surface that is extensively flat due to open conformation of the RNA binding loop. The NMR chemical shift perturbation study showed that dsRNA and 5'ppp-ssRNA are bound to the basic surface of LGP2 CTD, whereas dsRNA is bound to the basic surface of MDA5 CTD but much more weakly, indicating that the conformation of the RNA binding loop is responsible for the sensitivity to dsRNA and 5'ppp-ssRNA. Mutation study of the basic surface and the RNA binding loop supports the conclusion from the structure studies. Thus, the CTD is responsible for the binding affinity to the viral RNAs.},

ATP and dsRNA binding induce a major rearrangement to a closed conformation in which the helicase and CTD bind the blunt end 5′ppp-dsRNA with perfect complementarity but incompatibly with continued CARD binding. We propose that after initial binding of 5′ppp-dsRNA to the flexibly linked CTD, co-operative tight binding of ATP and RNA to the helicase domain liberates the CARDs for downstream signaling. These findings significantly advance our molecular understanding of the activation of innate immune signaling helicases. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Cytoplasmic RNA helicases, retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (mda-5) have been identified to function as receptors for double-stranded RNA. Here we show that interferon (IFN)-$\alpha$ pretreatment enhances influenza A virus-induced expression of IFN-$\alpha$, IFN-$\beta$, interleukin (IL)-28 and IL-29 genes in human dendritic cells and epithelial cell lines. Both IFN-$\alpha$ and IFN-$\beta$ strongly enhanced RIG-I and mda-5 mRNA and protein expression in these cell types. Expression of RIG-I and mda-5 gene constructs, but not that of TLR3, lead to a dramatic enhancement of IFN-$\beta$ promoter driven transcription in influenza A virus-infected epithelial cells. Furthermore, dominant negative RIG-I gene construct inhibited influenza A virus-induced IFN-$\beta$ promoter activity. In conclusion, our results show that in epithelial cells influenza A virus-induced antiviral cytokine gene expression is triggered by RIG-I and mda-5, whose expression is positively regulated by IFN-$\alpha$. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

Here we report the crystal structure of superfamily 2 (SF2) ATPase domain of RIG-I in complex with a nucleotide analogue. RIG-I SF2 comprises two RecA-like domains 1A and 2A and a helical insertion domain 2B, which together form a 'C'-shaped structure. Domains 1A and 2A are maintained in a 'signal-off' state with an inactive ATP hydrolysis site by an intriguing helical arm. By mutational analysis, we show surface motifs that are critical for dsRNA-stimulated ATPase activity, indicating that dsRNA induces a structural movement that brings domains 1A and 2A/B together to form an active ATPase site. The structure also indicates that the regulatory domain is close to the end of the helical arm, where it is well positioned to recruit 5'-ppp-dsRNA to the SF2 domain. Overall, our results indicate that the activation of RIG-I occurs through an RNA- and ATP-driven structural switch in the SF2 domain.},

The RIG-I translocon directs RIG-I redistribution from the cytosol to membranes where it mediates MAVS-dependent innate immune signaling during acute RNA virus infection. 14-3-3$\epsilon$ is essential for the stable interaction of RIG-I with TRIM25, which facilitates RIG-I ubiquitination and initiation of innate immunity against hepatitis C virus and other pathogenic RNA viruses.

This is blocked by the influenza protein nonstructured protein 1 (NS1), which is found in a complex with RIG-I in infected cells.

A helicase domain with intact ATPase activity was responsible for the dsRNA-mediated signaling. The caspase recruitment domain transmitted 'downstream' signals, resulting in the activation of transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF-3. Subsequent gene activation by these factors induced antiviral functions, including type I interferon production. Thus, RIG-I is key in the detection and subsequent eradication of the replicating viral genomes.},

abstract = {Intracellular RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs, including RIG-I, MDA-5, and LGP2) recognize viral RNAs as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate an antiviral immune response. To understand the molecular basis of this process, we determined the crystal structure of RIG-I in complex with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The dsRNA is sheathed within a network of protein domains that include a conserved "helicase" domain (regions HEL1 and HEL2), a specialized insertion domain (HEL2i), and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD). A V-shaped pincer connects HEL2 and the CTD by gripping an ??-helical shaft that extends from HEL1. In this way, the pincer coordinates functions of all the domains and couples RNA binding with ATP hydrolysis. RIG-I falls within the Dicer-RIG-I clade of the superfamily 2 helicases, and this structure reveals complex interplay between motor domains, accessory mechanical domains, and RNA that has implications for understanding the nanomechanical function of this protein family and other ATPases more broadly. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Melanoma differentiation associated gene-5 (mda-5) was identified by subtraction hybridization as a novel upregulated gene in HO-1 human melanoma cells induced to terminally differentiate by treatment with IFN-beta+MEZ. Considering its unique structure, consisting of a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and an RNA helicase domain, it was hypothesized that mda-5 contributes to apoptosis occurring during terminal differentiation. We have currently examined the expression pattern of mda-5 in normal tissues, during induction of terminal differentiation and after treatment with type I IFNs. In addition, we have defined its genomic structure and chromosomal location. IFN-beta, a type I IFN, induces mda-5 expression in a biphasic and dose-dependent manner. Based on its temporal kinetics of induction and lack of requirement for prior protein synthesis mda-5 is an early type I IFN-responsive gene. The level of mda-5 mRNA is in low abundance in normal tissues, whereas expression is induced in a spectrum of normal and cancer cells by IFN-beta. Expression of mda-5 by means of a replication incompetent adenovirus, Ad.mda-5, induces apoptosis in HO-1 cells as confirmed by morphologic, biochemical and molecular assays. Additionally, the combination of Ad.mda-5+MEZ further augments apoptosis as observed in Ad.null or uninfected HO-1 cells induced to terminally differentiate by treatment with IFN-beta+MEZ. The mda-5 gene is located on human chromosome 2q24 and consists of 16 exons, without pseudogenes, and is conserved in the mouse genome. Present data documents that mda-5 is a novel type I IFN-inducible gene, which may contribute to apoptosis induction during terminal differentiation and during IFN treatment. The conserved genomic and protein structure of mda-5 in human and mouse will permit analysis of the evolution and developmental aspects of this gene.},

However, the function of the DExH box helicase domain that is also required for activity is less clear. Using single-molecule protein-induced fluorescence enhancement, we discovered a robust adenosine 5'-triphosphate-powered dsRNA translocation activity of RIG-I. The CARDs dramatically suppress translocation in the absence of 5'-triphosphate, and the activation by 5'-triphosphate triggers RIG-I to translocate preferentially on dsRNA in cis.
