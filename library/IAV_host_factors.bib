abstract = {Influenza viruses cause epidemics and pandemics. Like all viruses, influenza viruses rely on the host cellular machinery to support their life cycle. Accordingly, identification of the host functions co-opted for viral replication is of interest to understand the mechanisms of the virus life cycle and to find new targets for the development of antiviral compounds. Among the various approaches used to explore host factor involvement in the influenza virus replication cycle, perhaps the most powerful is RNAi-based genome-wide screening, which has shed new light on the search for host factors involved in virus replication. In this review, we examine the cellular genes identified to date as important for influenza virus replication in genome-wide screens, assess pathways that were repeatedly identified in these studies, and discuss how these pathways might be involved in the individual steps of influenza virus replication, ultimately leading to a comprehensive understanding of the virus life cycle. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Influenza virus NS1 protein is an RNA-binding protein whose expression alters several posttranscriptional regulatory processes, like polyadenylation, splicing, and nucleocytoplasmic transport of cellular mRNAs. In addition, NS1 protein enhances the translational rate of viral, but not cellular, mRNAs. To characterize this effect, we looked for targets of NS1 influenza virus protein among cellular translation factors. We found that NS1 coimmunoprecipitates with eukaryotic initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI), the large subunit of the cap-binding complex eIF4F, either in influenza virus-infected cells or in cells transfected with NS1 cDNA. Affinity chromatography studies using a purified His-NS1 protein-containing matrix showed that the fusion protein pulls down endogenous eIF4GI from COS-1 cells and labeled eIF4GI translated in vitro, but not the eIF4E subunit of the eIF4F factor. Similar in vitro binding experiments with eIF4GI deletion mutants indicated that the NS1-binding domain of eIF4GI is located between residues 157 and 550, in a region where no other component of the translational machinery is known to interact. Moreover, using overlay assays and pull-down experiments, we showed that NS1 and eIF4GI proteins interact directly, in an RNA-independent manner. Mapping of the eIF4GI-binding domain in the NS1 protein indicated that the first 113 N-terminal amino acids of the protein, but not the first 81, are sufficient to bind eIF4GI. The first of these mutants has been previously shown to act as a translational enhancer, while the second is defective in this activity. Collectively, these and previously published data suggest a model where NS1 recruits eIF4GI specifically to the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of the viral mRNA, allowing for the preferential translation of the influenza virus messengers.},

abstract = {Virions are thought to contain all the essential proteins that govern virus egress from the host cell and initiation of replication in the target cell. It has been known for some time that influenza virions contain nine viral proteins; however, analyses of other enveloped viruses have revealed that proteins from the host cell can also be detected in virions. To address whether the same is true for influenza virus, we used two complementary mass spectrometry approaches to perform a comprehensive proteomic analysis of purified influenza virus particles. In addition to the aforementioned nine virus-encoded proteins, we detected the presence of 36 host-encoded proteins. These include both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound proteins that can be grouped into several functional categories, such as cytoskeletal proteins, annexins, glycolytic enzymes, and tetraspanins. Interestingly, a significant number of these have also been reported to be present in virions of other virus families. Protease treatment of virions combined with immunoblot analysis was used to verify the presence of the cellular protein and also to determine whether it is located in the core of the influenza virus particle. Immunogold labeling confirmed the presence of membrane-bound host proteins on the influenza virus envelope. The identification of cellular constituents of influenza virions has important implications for understanding the interactions of influenza virus with its host and brings us a step closer to defining the cellular requirements for influenza virus replication. While not all of the host proteins are necessarily incorporated specifically, those that are and are found to have an essential role represent novel targets for antiviral drugs and for attenuation of viruses for vaccine purposes.},

abstract = {Increasing antiviral drug resistance is a major concern for treating influenza, especially in a pandemic setting when the availability of a protective vaccine is uncertain. Resistance is often an issue with drugs directed at viral proteins and for small RNA viruses; there are also a limited number of viral proteins that are amenable to inhibition by a small molecule. A new approach that is gaining support is that cellular proteins, which facilitate virus replication, may be used as alternative targets. Whereas drugs directed at viral proteins tend to be virus-specific, drugs directed at host targets have the potential to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity as many viruses may share a dependency on that host function. For influenza virus, we have very limited knowledge of which cellular factors are involved in virus replication, let alone which of these have suitable properties to serve as drug targets. Through the use of high-throughput RNA interference screens, several studies have addressed this gap in our knowledge. The resulting datasets provide new insight into host pathways that are involved in the influenza virus replication cycle and identify specific host factors in these pathways that may serve as potential targets for future antiviral drug development.},

abstract = {The negative-sense RNA genome of influenza A virus is transcribed and replicated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). The viral RdRP is an important host range determinant, indicating that its function is affected by interactions with cellular factors. However, the identities and the roles of most of these factors remain unknown. Here, we employed affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry to identify cellular proteins that interact with the influenza A virus RdRP in infected human cells. We purified RdRPs using a recombinant influenza virus in which the PB2 subunit of the RdRP is fused to a Strep-tag. When this tagged subunit was purified from infected cells, copurifying proteins included the other RdRP subunits (PB1 and PA) and the viral nucleoprotein and neuraminidase, as well as 171 cellular proteins. Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry revealed that the most abundant of these host proteins were chaperones, cytoskeletal proteins, importins, proteins involved in ubiquitination, kinases and phosphatases, and mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins. Among the phosphatases, we identified three subunits of the cellular serine/threonine protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), including the catalytic subunit PPP6C and regulatory subunits PPP6R1 and PPP6R3. PP6 was found to interact directly with the PB1 and PB2 subunits of the viral RdRP, and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of the catalytic subunit of PP6 in infected cells resulted in the reduction of viral RNA accumulation and the attenuation of virus growth. These results suggest that PP6 interacts with and positively regulates the activity of the influenza virus RdRP. IMPORTANCE: Influenza A viruses are serious clinical and veterinary pathogens, causing substantial health and economic impacts. In addition to annual seasonal epidemics, occasional global pandemics occur when viral strains adapt to humans from other species. To replicate efficiently and cause disease, influenza viruses must interact with a large number of host factors. The reliance of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) on host factors makes it a major host range determinant. This study describes and quantifies host proteins that interact, directly or indirectly, with a subunit of the RdRP. It increases our understanding of the role of host proteins in viral replication and identifies a large number of potential barriers to pandemic emergence. Identifying host factors allows their importance for viral replication to be tested. Here, we demonstrate a role for the cellular phosphatase PP6 in promoting viral replication, contributing to our emerging knowledge of regulatory phosphorylation in influenza virus biology.},

abstract = {Recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) have been shown to induce protective immunity. Despite their potential significance as promising vaccine candidates, the protein composition of VLPs produced in insect cells has not been well characterized. Here we report a proteomic analysis of influenza VLPs containing hemagglutinin (HA) and matrix M1 proteins from a human isolate of avian influenza H5N1 virus (H5 VLPs) produced in insect cells using the recombinant baculovirus expression system. Comprehensive proteomic analysis of purified H5 VLPs identified viral proteins and 37 additional host-derived proteins, many of which are known to be present in other enveloped viruses. Proteins involved in different cellular structures and functions were found to be present in H5 VLPs including those from the cytoskeleton, translation, chaperone, and metabolism. Immunization with purified H5 VLPs induced protective immunity, which was comparable to the inactivated whole virus containing all viral components. Unpurified H5 VLPs containing excess amounts of noninfluenza soluble proteins also conferred 100\% protection against lethal challenge although lower immune responses were induced. These results provide important implications consistent with the idea that VLP production in insect cells may involve similar cellular machinery as other RNA enveloped viruses during synthesis, assembly, trafficking, and budding processes.},

abstract = {The effect of NS1 protein on the efficiency of influenza virus mRNA translation was evaluated by determining the accumulation of nucleoprotein (NP) or M1 mRNAs in the cytoplasm of cells expressing either of these genes alone or in combination with the NS1 gene, as well as the total cell accumulation of NP or M1 protein. Coexpression of NS1, but not of NS2 protein, led to increases in the translation of these mRNAs in the range of 5- to 100-fold. This translation enhancement was specific for viral mRNAs, since the translation of neither cat nor lacZ mRNAs was affected by the coexpression of NS1 protein. The use of chimeric cat genes containing the 5'-extracistronic sequences of the influenza virus mRNAs corresponding to segment 2, 7, or 8 indicated that these sequences can in part account for the observed effect. The enhancement of viral mRNA translation mediated by NS1 protein was due to an increase in the translation initiation rate, since the sizes of NP-specific polysomes, but not those of lacZ-specific polysomes, was significantly higher in cells coexpressing NS1 protein than in those expressing only the NP gene.},

abstract = {Following the initial and sporadic emergence into humans of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A viruses in Hong Kong in 1997, we have come to realize the potential for avian influenza A viruses to be transmitted directly from birds to humans. Understanding the basic viral and cellular mechanisms that contribute to infection of mammalian species with avian influenza viruses is essential for developing prevention and control measures against possible future human pandemics. Multiple physical and functional cellular barriers can restrict influenza A virus infection in a new host species, including the cell membrane, the nuclear envelope, the nuclear environment, and innate antiviral responses. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on viral and host factors required for avian H5N1 influenza A viruses to successfully establish infections in mammalian cells. We focus on the molecular mechanisms underpinning mammalian host restrictions, as well as the adaptive mutations that are necessary for an avian influenza virus to overcome them. It is likely that many more viral and host determinants remain to be discovered, and future research in this area should provide novel and translational insights into the biology of influenza virus-host interactions.},

These HPKs were found to affect multiple host pathways and regulated by miRNAs induced during infection. Using a panel of miRNA agonists and antagonists, miR-149* was found to regulate NEK8 expression, miR-548d-3p was found to regulate MAPK1 transcript expression, and miRs -1228 and -138 to regulate CDK13 expression. Up-regulation of miR-34c induced PLK4 transcript and protein expression and enhanced influenza virus replication, while miR-34c inhibition reduced viral replication.

MCM interacted with the PA subunit of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is found to be involved in the replication genetically. The virus genome replication was decreased in MCM2 knockdown cells. The viral polymerase appeared to be a nonproductive complex, that is, it was capable of initiating replication but produced only abortive short RNA chains. MCM stimulated de novo-initiated replication reaction by stabilizing a replication complex during its transition from initiation to elongation. Based on the findings, including the result that the MCM-mediated RNA replication reaction was competed with exogenously added RNA, we propose that MCM functions as a scaffold between the nascent RNA chains and the viral polymerase.},

abstract = {Conventional approaches for therapeutic targeting of viral pathogens have consistently faced obstacles arising from the development of resistant strains and a lack of broad-spectrum application. Influenza represents a particularly problematic therapeutic challenge since high viral mutation rates have often confounded many conventional antivirals. Newly emerging or engineered strains of influenza represent an even greater threat as typified by recent interest in avian subtypes of influenza. Based on the limitations associated with targeting virally-encoded molecules, we have taken an orthogonal approach of targeting host pathways in a manner that prevents viral propagation or spares the host from virus-mediated pathogenicity. To this end, we report herein the application of an improved technology for target discovery, Random Homozygous Gene Perturbation (RHGP), to identify host-oriented targets that are well-tolerated in normal cells but that prevent influenza-mediated killing of host cells. Improvements in RHGP facilitated a thorough screening of the entire genome, both for overexpression or loss of expression, to identify targets that render host cells resistant to influenza infection. We identify a set of host-oriented targets that prevent influenza killing of host cells and validate these targets using multiple approaches. These studies provide further support for a new paradigm to combat viral disease and demonstrate the power of RHGP to identify novel targets and mechanisms. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {It has previously been shown that influenza virus NS1 protein enhances the translation of viral but not cellular mRNAs. This enhancement occurs by increasing the rate of translation initiation and requires the 5'UTR sequence, common to all viral mRNAs. In agreement with these findings, we show here that viral mRNAs, but not cellular mRNAs, are associated with NS1 during virus infection. We have previously reported that NS1 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF4GI, next to its poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1)-interacting domain and that NS1 and eIF4GI are associated in influenza virus-infected cells. Here we show that NS1, although capable of binding poly(A), does not compete with PABP1 for association with eIF4GI and, furthermore, that NS1 and PABP1 interact both in vivo and in vitro in an RNA-independent manner. The interaction maps between residues 365 and 535 in PABP1 and between residues 1 and 81 in NS1. These mapping studies, together with those previously reported for NS1-eIF4GI and PABP1-eIF4GI interactions, imply that the binding of all three proteins would be compatible. Collectively, these and previously published data suggest that NS1 interactions with eIF4GI and PABP1, as well as with viral mRNAs, could promote the specific recruitment of 43S complexes to the viral mRNAs.},

abstract = {Enveloped viruses often enter cells via endocytosis; however, specific endocytic trafficking pathway(s) for many viruses have not been determined. Here we demonstrate, through the use of dominant-negative Rab5 and Rab7, that influenza virus (Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/X-31 (H3N2)) requires both early and late endosomes for entry and subsequent infection in HeLa cells. Time-course experiments, monitoring viral ribonucleoprotein colocalization with endosomal markers, indicated that influenza exhibits a conventional endocytic uptake pattern--reaching early endosomes after approximately 10 min, and late endosomes after 40 min. Detection with conformation-specific hemagglutinin antibodies indicated that hemagglutinin did not reach a fusion-competent form until the virus had trafficked beyond early endosomes. We also examined two other enveloped viruses that are also pH-dependent for entry--Semliki Forest virus and vesicular stomatitis virus. In contrast to influenza virus, infection with both Semliki Forest virus and vesicular stomatitis virus was inhibited only by the expression of dominant negative Rab5 and not by dominant negative Rab7, indicating an independence of late endosome function for infection by these viruses. As a whole, these data provide a definitive characterization of influenza virus endocytic trafficking and show differential requirements for endocytic trafficking between pH-dependent enveloped viruses.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus, being responsible for seasonal epidemics and reoccurring pandemics, represents a worldwide threat to public health. High mutation rates facilitate the generation of viral escape mutants, rendering vaccines and drugs directed against virus-encoded targets potentially ineffective. In contrast, targeting host cell determinants temporarily dispensable for the host but crucial for virus replication could prevent viral escape. Here we report the discovery of 287 human host cell genes influencing influenza A virus replication in a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen. Using an independent assay we confirmed 168 hits (59\%) inhibiting either the endemic H1N1 (119 hits) or the current pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A virus strains, with an overlap of 60\%. Notably, a subset of these common hits was also essential for replication of a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain. In-depth analyses of several factors provided insights into their infection stage relevance. Notably, SON DNA binding protein (SON) was found to be important for normal trafficking of influenza virions to late endosomes early in infection. We also show that a small molecule inhibitor of CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1) reduces influenza virus replication by more than two orders of magnitude, an effect connected with impaired splicing of the viral M2 messenger RNA. Furthermore, influenza-virus-infected p27(-/-) (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; Cdkn1b) mice accumulated significantly lower viral titres in the lung, providing in vivo evidence for the importance of this gene. Thus, our results highlight the potency of genome-wide RNAi screening for the dissection of virus-host interactions and the identification of drug targets for a broad range of influenza viruses.},

After hemagglutinin-mediated membrane fusion in late endocytic vacuoles, the vRNPs and the matrix proteins dissociate from each other and disperse within the cytosol. Here, we found that for capsid disassembly, IAV takes advantage of the host cell's aggresome formation and disassembly machinery. The capsids mimicked misfolded protein aggregates by carrying unanchored ubiquitin chains that activated a histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-dependent pathway. The ubiquitin-binding domain was essential for recruitment of HDAC6 to viral fusion sites and for efficient uncoating and infection. That other components of the aggresome processing machinery, including dynein, dynactin, and myosin II, were also required suggested that physical forces generated by microtubule- and actin-associated motors are essential for IAV entry.},

In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge gathered on this interplay between influenza viruses and the cellular spliceosome, with a particular focus on influenza A viruses (IAV). These viruses have developed accurate regulation mechanisms to reassign the host spliceosome to alter host cellular expression and enable an optimal expression of specific spliced viral products throughout infection. Moreover, IAV segments undergoing splicing display high levels of similarity with human consensus splice sites and their viral transcripts show noteworthy secondary structures. Sequence alignments and consensus analyses, along with recently published studies, suggest both conservation and evolution of viral splice site sequences and structure for improved adaptation to the host. Altogether, these results emphasize the ability of IAV to be well adapted to the host's splicing machinery, and further investigations may contribute to a better understanding of splicing regulation with regard to viral replication, host range, and pathogenesis.},

Here, we identify epsin 1, a clathrin-, ubiquitin-, and phospholipid-interacting protein, as a cargo-specific adaptor for influenza virus entry through the clathrin-mediated pathway. Using live-cell imaging to monitor the entry of individual virus particles, we observed recruitment of epsin 1 to the binding sites of influenza viruses in synchrony with the assembly of CCPs. Epsin 1 knockdown by siRNA significantly inhibited the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the influenza virus and caused the majority of the virus particles to enter through a clathrin-independent pathway. The same treatment did not affect the entry of several classical ligands for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including transferrin, LDL, and EGF. Overexpression of the dominant-negative epsin 1 mutant lacking the ubiquitin-interaction motifs nearly completely blocked the clathrin-mediated entry of the influenza virus without affecting transferrin uptake. These results suggest that epsin 1 functions as a cargo-specific adaptor for the clathrin-mediated entry of the influenza virus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza is a common infectious disease caused by influenza viruses. Annual epidemics cause severe illnesses, deaths, and economic loss around the world. To better defend against influenza viral infection, it is essential to understand its mechanisms and associated host responses. Many studies have been conducted to elucidate these mechanisms, however, the overall picture remains incompletely understood. A systematic understanding of influenza viral infection in host cells is needed to facilitate the identification of influential host response mechanisms and potential drug targets.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESCRIPTION: We constructed a comprehensive map of the influenza A virus ('IAV') life cycle ('FluMap') by undertaking a literature-based, manual curation approach. Based on information obtained from publicly available pathway databases, updated with literature-based information and input from expert virologists and immunologists, FluMap is currently composed of 960 factors (i.e., proteins, mRNAs etc.) and 456 reactions, and is annotated with \~{}500 papers and curation comments. In addition to detailing the type of molecular interactions, isolate/strain specific data are also available. The FluMap was built with the pathway editor CellDesigner in standard SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) format and visualized as an SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation) diagram. It is also available as a web service (online map) based on the iPathways+ system to enable community discussion by influenza researchers. We also demonstrate computational network analyses to identify targets using the FluMap.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The FluMap is a comprehensive pathway map that can serve as a graphically presented knowledge-base and as a platform to analyze functional interactions between IAV and host factors. Publicly available webtools will allow continuous updating to ensure the most reliable representation of the host-virus interaction network. The FluMap is available at http://www.influenza-x.org/flumap/.},

Among these virion components, the mechanism of vRNP delivery is the most incompletely understood. Here, we reveal a functional relationship between the cellular Rab11 GTPase isoform, RAB11A, and vRNPs and show that RAB11A is indispensable for proper vRNP transport to the plasma membrane. Using an immunofluorescence-based assay with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes nucleoprotein in the form of vRNP, we demonstrate association between RAB11A and vRNPs at all stages of vRNP cytoplasmic transport. Abrogation of RAB11A expression through small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment or disruption of RAB11A function by overexpression of dominant negative or constitutively active proteins caused aberrant vRNP intracellular accumulation, retention in the perinuclear region, and lack of accumulation at the plasma membrane. Complex formation between RAB11A and vRNPs was further established biochemically. Our results uncover a critical host factor with an essential contribution to influenza virus genome delivery and reveal a potential role for RAB11A in the transport of ribonucleoprotein cargo.},

abstract = {Replication of the RNAs of influenza virus occurs in the nucleus of infected cells. The nucleoprotein (NP) has been shown to be important for the import of the viral RNA into the nucleus and has been proposed to contain at least three different nuclear localization signals (NLSs). Here, an import assay in digitonin-permeabilized cells was used to further define the contribution of these NLSs. Mutation of the unconventional NLS impaired the nuclear import of the NP. A peptide bearing the unconventional NLS could inhibit the nuclear import of the NP in this import assay and prevent the NP-karyopherin alpha interaction in a binding assay confirming the crucial role of this signal. Interestingly, a peptide containing the SV40 T antigen NLS was unable to inhibit the nuclear import of NP or the NP-karyopherin alpha interaction, suggesting that the NP and the SV40 T antigen do not share a common binding site on karyopherin alpha. We also investigated the question of which NLS(s) is/are necessary for the viral ribonucleoprotein complex to enter the nucleus. We found that the peptide containing the unconventional NLS efficiently inhibited the nuclear import of the ribonucleoprotein complexes. This finding suggests that the unconventional NLS is the major signal necessary not only for the nuclear transport of free NP but also for the import of the ribonucleoprotein complexes. Finally, viral replication could be specifically inhibited by a membrane-permeable peptide containing the unconventional NLS, confirming the crucial role of this signal during the replicative cycle of the virus.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus is an RNA virus that encodes up to 11 proteins and this small coding capacity demands that the virus use the host cellular machinery for many aspects of its life cycle. Knowledge of these host cell requirements not only informs us of the molecular pathways exploited by the virus but also provides further targets that could be pursued for antiviral drug development. Here we use an integrative systems approach, based on genome-wide RNA interference screening, to identify 295 cellular cofactors required for early-stage influenza virus replication. Within this group, those involved in kinase-regulated signalling, ubiquitination and phosphatase activity are the most highly enriched, and 181 factors assemble into a highly significant host-pathogen interaction network. Moreover, 219 of the 295 factors were confirmed to be required for efficient wild-type influenza virus growth, and further analysis of a subset of genes showed 23 factors necessary for viral entry, including members of the vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) and COPI-protein families, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) proteins, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-beta. Furthermore, 10 proteins were confirmed to be involved in post-entry steps of influenza virus replication. These include nuclear import components, proteases, and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) IIbeta (CAMK2B). Notably, growth of swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus is also dependent on the identified host factors, and we show that small molecule inhibitors of several factors, including vATPase and CAMK2B, antagonize influenza virus replication.},

abstract = {All viruses rely on host cell proteins and their associated mechanisms to complete the viral life cycle. Identifying the host molecules that participate in each step of virus replication could provide valuable new targets for antiviral therapy, but this goal may take several decades to achieve with conventional forward genetic screening methods and mammalian cell cultures. Here we describe a novel genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila that can be used to identify host genes important for influenza virus replication. After modifying influenza virus to allow infection of Drosophila cells and detection of influenza virus gene expression, we tested an RNAi library against 13,071 genes (90\% of the Drosophila genome), identifying over 100 for which suppression in Drosophila cells significantly inhibited or stimulated reporter gene (Renilla luciferase) expression from an influenza-virus-derived vector. The relevance of these findings to influenza virus infection of mammalian cells is illustrated for a subset of the Drosophila genes identified; that is, for three implicated Drosophila genes, the corresponding human homologues ATP6V0D1, COX6A1 and NXF1 are shown to have key functions in the replication of H5N1 and H1N1 influenza A viruses, but not vesicular stomatitis virus or vaccinia virus, in human HEK 293 cells. Thus, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using genome-wide RNAi screens in Drosophila to identify previously unrecognized host proteins that are required for influenza virus replication. This could accelerate the development of new classes of antiviral drugs for chemoprophylaxis and treatment, which are urgently needed given the obstacles to rapid development of an effective vaccine against pandemic influenza and the probable emergence of strains resistant to available drugs.},

In order to be packaged into viral particles at the plasma membrane, encapsidated viral genomes must be exported from the nucleus. Intriguingly, the nuclear export protein NEP is involved in both processes. While NEP stimulates viral RNA synthesis by binding to the viral polymerase, its function during nuclear export implicates interaction with vRNP-associated M1. The observation that both interactions are mediated by the C-terminal moiety of NEP raised the question whether these two features of NEP are functionally linked. Here, we provide evidence that the interaction between M1 and the vRNP depends on the NEP C-terminus and its polymerase activity-enhancing property for nuclear export of vRNPs. This suggests that these features of NEP are functionally linked. Furthermore, our data suggest that the N-terminal domain of NEP interferes with the stability of the vRNP/M1/NEP nuclear export complex, probably mediated by its highly flexible intramolecular interaction with the NEP C-terminus. Based on our data, we propose a new model for the assembly of the nuclear export complex of Influenza A virus RNPs.},

We discovered that the interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins IFITM1, 2, and 3 restrict an early step in influenza A viral replication. The IFITM proteins confer basal resistance to influenza A virus but are also inducible by interferons type I and II and are critical for interferon's virustatic actions. Further characterization revealed that the IFITM proteins inhibit the early replication of flaviviruses, including dengue virus and West Nile virus.

To improve this situation, we performed comprehensive, proteomics-based screens to identify cellular factors associated with the native vRNP and viral polymerase complexes. Reconstituted vRNPs were purified from human cells using Strep-tagged viral nucleoprotein (NP-Strep) as bait, and co-purified cellular factors were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). In parallel, reconstituted native influenza A polymerase complexes were isolated using tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged polymerase subunits as bait, and co-purified cellular factors were again identified by MS. Using these techniques, we identified 41 proteins that co-purified with NP-Strep-enriched vRNPs and four cellular proteins that co-purified with the viral polymerase complex. Two of the polymerase-associated factors, importin-beta3 and PARP-1, represent novel interaction partners. Most cellular proteins previously shown to interact with either viral NP and/or vRNP were also identified using our method, demonstrating its sensitivity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies in virus-infected cells using selected novel interaction partners, including nucleophosmin (NPM), confirmed their association with vRNP. Immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that NPM is recruited to sites of viral transcription and replication in infected cells. Additionally, overexpression of NPM resulted in increased viral polymerase activity, indicating its role in viral RNA synthesis. In summary, the proteomics-based approaches used in this study represent powerful tools to identify novel vRNP-associated cellular factors for further characterization.},

abstract = {Abstract Influenza is still one of the major plagues worldwide with the threatening potential to cause pandemics. In recent years, increasing levels of resistance to the four FDA approved anti-influenza virus drugs have been described. This situation underlines the urgent need for novel anti-virals in preparation for future influenza epidemics or pandemics. Although the anti-virals currently in use target viral factors such as the neuraminidase or the M2 ion channel, there is an increase in pre-clinical approaches that focus on cellular factors or pathways that directly or indirectly interact with virus replication. This does not only include inhibitors of virus-supportive signaling cascades but also interaction blockers of viral proteins with host cell proteins. This review aims to highlight some of these novel approaches that represent a paradigm change in anti-viral strategies against the influenza virus. Although most of these approaches are still in an early phase of preclinical development they might be very promising particularly with respect to the prevention of viral resistance to potential drugs.},

abstract = {For replication and transcription of the influenza virus genome of eight-segmented and negative-stranded RNAs, not only viral factors but also host-derived cellular factors (host factors) are required. This paper focuses on the identification and characterisation of the host factors involved in replication and transcription of the influenza virus genome, reviewing recent progresses in the related molecular mechanisms. Functional assay systems for screening of host factors using cell-free reconstitution systems and an yeast-based influenza virus replicon system are highlighted. We have summarised the property of host factors comprehensively and provided a clue for the perspective in the determination mechanism of host range and virulence and the development of a new strategy to control the influenza virus.},
