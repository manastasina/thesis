abstract = {Hemagglutinin (HA) is the receptor-binding and membrane fusion gly- coprotein of influenza virus and the target for infectivity-neutralizing antibodies. The structures of three conformations of the ectodomain of the 1968 Hong Kong influenza virus HA have been determined by X-ray crystallography: the single-chain precursor, HA0; the metastable neutral-pH conformation found on virus, and the fusion pH- induced conformation. These structures provide a framework for designing and inter- preting the results of experiments on the activity of HA in receptor binding, the gener- ation of emerging and reemerging epidemics, and membrane fusion during viral entry.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus genome consists of eight segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNAs. Each viral RNA (vRNA) segment forms a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex together with NPs and a polymerase complex, which is a fundamental unit for transcription and replication of the viral genome. Although the exact structure of the intact RNP remains poorly understood, recent electron microscopic studies have revealed certain structural characteristics of the RNP. This review focuses on the findings of these various electron microscopic analyses of RNPs extracted from virions and RNPs inside virions. Based on the morphological and structural observations, we present the architecture of RNPs within a virion and discuss the genome packaging mechanism by which the vRNA segments are incorporated into virions.},

abstract = {The receptor specificity of 56 H2 and H3 influenza virus isolates from various animal species has been determined to test the relevance of receptor specificity to the ecology of influenza virus. The results show that the receptor specificity of both H2 and H3 isolates evaluated for sialic acid linkage specificity and inhibition of hemagglutination by horse serum correlates with the species of origin, as postulated earlier for H3 strains based on a limited survey of five human, three avian, and one equine strain. Elucidation of the amino acid sequence of several human H2 receptor variants and analysis of known sequences of H2 and H3 isolates revealed that receptor specificity varies in association with an amino acid change at residues 228 in addition to the change at residue 226 previously documented to affect receptor specificity of H3 but not H1 isolates. Residues 226 and 228 are leucine and serine in human isolates, which preferentially bind sialic acid alpha 2,6-galactose beta 1,4-N-acetyl glucosamine (SA alpha 2,6Gal), and glutamine and glycine in avian and equine isolates, which exhibit specificity for sialic acid alpha-2,3-galactose beta-1,3-N-acetyl galactosamine (SA alpha 2,3Gal). The results demonstrate that the correlation of receptor specificity and species of origin is maintained across both H2 and H3 influenza virus serotypes and provide compelling evidence that influenza virus hosts exert selective pressure to maintain the receptor specificity characteristics of strains isolated from that species.},

abstract = {The question of how genetic materials are trafficked in and out of the cell nucleus is a problem of great importance not only for understanding viral infections but also for advancing gene-delivery technology. Here we demonstrate a physical technique that allows gene trafficking to be studied at the single-gene level by combining sensitive fluorescence microscopy with microinjection. As a model system, we investigate the nuclear import of influenza genes, in the form of ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), by imaging single vRNPs in living cells in real time. Our single-particle trajectories show that vRNPs are transported to the nuclear envelope by diffusion. We have observed heterogeneous interactions between the vRNPs and nuclear pore complexes with dissociation rate constants spanning two orders of magnitude. Our single-particle tracking experiments also provided new insights into the regulation mechanisms for the nuclear import of vRNPs: the influenza M1 protein, a regulatory protein for the import process, downregulates the nuclear import of vRNPs by inhibiting the interactions between vRNPs and nuclear pore complexes but has no significant effect on the transport properties of vRNPs. We expect this single-particle tracking approach to find broad application in investigations of genetic trafficking.},

abstract = {We developed a unique monoclonal antibody, mAb61A5, using the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) strain. Truncation and alanine substitution experiments showed that mAb61A5 recognized the NP fragment with residues 17 to 123 in which a conformational epitope formed by the ??1 sheet and the linker region between the ??1 and ??2 helices. Variations in the epitope or nearby can partly account for the poor mAb61A5 reactivity with the NP of A/Aichi/2/68 or A/duck/Pennsylvania/10128/84 strains. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that mAb61A5 preferentially interacted with viral ribonucleoprotein complexes, composed of RNA polymerase, negative/positive sense RNA and NP, rather than exogenously added NP. Immunofluorescence microscopy using mAb61A5 showed a punctate staining in the cytoplasm during the late phase of infection. The punctate NPs accumulated at the microtubule organizing center and co-localized with microtubules. The treatment with leptomycin B to block a CRM1-dependent nuclear export failed to produce the punctate NP. The treatment with nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, showed random distribution of the punctate NP in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that microtubule networks, although were not required for the formation of punctate structures, were responsible for the polarized distribution of the punctate NP antigens, most likely viral progeny ribonucleoprotein complexes. ?? 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Influenza is a paradigm for understanding viral infections. As an opportunistic pathogen exploiting the cellular endocytic machinery for infection, influenza is also a valuable model system for exploring the cell's constitutive endocytic pathway. We have studied the transport, acidification, and fusion of single influenza viruses in living cells by using real-time fluorescence microscopy and have dissected individual stages of the viral entry pathway. The movement of individual viruses revealed a striking three-stage active transport process that preceded viral fusion with endosomes starting with an actin-dependent movement in the cell periphery, followed by a rapid, dynein-directed translocation to the perinuclear region, and finally an intermittent movement involving both plus- and minus-end-directed microtubule-based motilities in the perinuclear region. Surprisingly, the majority of viruses experience their initial acidification in the perinuclear region immediately following the dynein-directed rapid translocation step. This finding suggests a previously undescribed scenario of the endocytic pathway toward late endosomes: endosome maturation, including initial acidification, largely occurs in the perinuclear region.},

abstract = {During the budding of enveloped viruses from the plasma membrane, the lipids are not randomly incorporated into the envelope, but virions seem to have a lipid composition different from the host membrane. Here, we have analyzed lipid assemblies in three different viruses: fowl plague virus (FPV) from the influenza virus family, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Semliki Forest virus (SFV). Analysis of detergent extractability of proteins, cholesterol, phosphoglycerolipids, and sphingomyelin in virions showed that FPV contains high amounts of detergent-insoluble complexes, whereas such complexes are largely absent from VSV or SFV. Cholesterol depletion from the viral envelope by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin results in increased solubility of sphingomyelin and of the glycoproteins in the FPV envelope. This biochemical behavior suggests that so-called raft-lipid domains are selectively incorporated into the influenza virus envelope. The "fluidity" of the FPV envelope, as measured by the fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene, was significantly lower than compared with VSV or SFV. Furthermore, influenza virus hemagglutinin incorporated into the envelope of recombinant VSV was largely detergent-soluble, indicating the depletion of raft-lipid assemblies from this membrane. The results provide a model for lipid selectivity during virus budding and support the view of lipid rafts as cholesterol-dependent, ordered domains in biological membranes.},

abstract = {The influenza virus polymerase, a heterotrimer composed of three subunits, PA, PB1 and PB2, is responsible for replication and transcription of the eight separate segments of the viral RNA genome in the nuclei of infected cells. The polymerase synthesizes viral messenger RNAs using short capped primers derived from cellular transcripts by a unique 'cap-snatching' mechanism. The PB2 subunit binds the 5' cap of host pre-mRNAs, which are subsequently cleaved after 10-13 nucleotides by the viral endonuclease, hitherto thought to reside in the PB2 (ref. 5) or PB1 (ref. 2) subunits. Here we describe biochemical and structural studies showing that the amino-terminal 209 residues of the PA subunit contain the endonuclease active site. We show that this domain has intrinsic RNA and DNA endonuclease activity that is strongly activated by manganese ions, matching observations reported for the endonuclease activity of the intact trimeric polymerase. Furthermore, this activity is inhibited by 2,4-dioxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid, a known inhibitor of the influenza endonuclease. The crystal structure of the domain reveals a structural core closely resembling resolvases and type II restriction endonucleases. The active site comprises a histidine and a cluster of three acidic residues, conserved in all influenza viruses, which bind two manganese ions in a configuration similar to other two-metal-dependent endonucleases. Two active site residues have previously been shown to specifically eliminate the polymerase endonuclease activity when mutated. These results will facilitate the optimisation of endonuclease inhibitors as potential new anti-influenza drugs.},

abstract = {We propose a mechanism for the priming of influenza viral RNA transcription by capped RNAs in which specific 5'-terminal fragments are cleaved from the capped RNAs by a virion-associated endonuclease. These fragments would serve as the actual primers for the initiation of transcription by the initial incorporation by the initial incorporation of a G residue at their 3' end. We show that virions and purified viral cores contain a unique endonuclease that cleaves RNAs containing a 5' methylated cap structure (m7GpppXm) preferentially at purine residues 10 to 14 nucleotides from the cap, generating fragments with 3'-terminal hydroxyl groups. RNAs containing the 5'-terminal structure GpppG could not be cleaved to produce these specific fragments. Consistent with our proposed mechanism, those capped fragments that function as primers could be linked to a G residue in transcriptase reactions containing alpha-32P-GTP as the only ribonucleoside triphosphate. The pattern of G and C incorporation onto these primer fragments suggests that this incorporation is directed by the second and third bases at the 3' end of the virion RNA template, which has the sequence 3' UCG. Primer fragments with a 3'-terminal A residue were used more efficiently than those with a 3'-terminal G residue, indicating a preference for generating an AGC sequence in the viral mRNA complementary to the 3' end of the virion RNA. Cleavage of the RNA primer and initiation of transcription are not necessarily coupled, because a 5' fragment isolated from one reaction could be used as a primer when added to a second reaction. Uncapped ribopolymer inhibitors of viral RNA transcription inhibited the cleavage of capped RNAs.},

abstract = {As all the enveloped viruses, the entry of influenza viruses includes a number of steps in host cell infection. This chapter summarizes the current knowledge of the entry pathway and the role of the fusion protein of influenza virus, hemagglutinin, in this process. Hemagglutinin (HA) is a trimeric glycoprotein that is present in multiple copies in the membrane envelope of influenza virus. HA contains a fusion peptide, a receptor binding site, a metastable structural motif, and the transmembrane domain. The first step of influenza virus entry is the recognition of the host cell receptor molecule, terminal $\alpha$-sialic acid, by HA. This multivalent attachment by multiple copies of trimetric HA triggers endocytosis of influenza virus that is contained in the endosome. The endosome-trapped virus traffics via a unidirectional pathway to near the nucleus. At this location, the interior pH of the endosome becomes acidic that induces a dramatic conformational change in HA to insert the fusion peptide into the host membrane, induce juxtaposition of the two membranes, and form a fusion pore that allows the release of the genome segments of influenza virus. HA plays a key role in the entire entry pathway. Inhibitors of virus entry are potentially effective antiviral drugs of influenza viruses.},

By using mass spectrometry, we identified tyrosine 132 (Y132) as a phosphorylation site of the matrix protein (M1) of the influenza virus A/WSN/1933(H1N1). Phosphorylation at this site is essential to the process of virus replication by controlling the nuclear import of M1. We further demonstrated that the phosphorylated tyrosine is crucial for the binding of M1 to the nuclear import factor importin-$\alpha$1, since any substitutions at this site severely reduce this protein-protein interaction and damage the importin-$\alpha$1-mediated nuclear import of M1. Additionally, the tyrosine phosphorylation which leads to the nuclear import of M1 is blocked by a Janus kinase inhibitor. The present study reveals a pivotal role of this tyrosine phosphorylation in the intracellular transportation of M1, which controls the process of viral replication.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase produces capped and polyadenylated mRNAs in the nucleus of infected cells that resemble mature cellular mRNAs, but are made by very different mechanisms. Furthermore, only two of the 10 viral protein-coding mRNAs are spliced: most are intronless, while two contain unremoved introns. The mechanism(s) by which any of these mRNAs are exported from the nucleus is uncertain. To probe the involvement of the primary cellular mRNA export pathway, we treated cells with siRNAs against NXF1, Aly or UAP56, or with the drug 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB), an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation previously shown to inhibit nuclear export of cellular mRNA as well as influenza virus segment 7 mRNAs. Depletion of NXF1 or DRB treatment had similar effects, inhibiting the nuclear export of several of the viral mRNAs. However, differing degrees of sensitivity were seen, depending on the particular segment examined. Intronless HA mRNA and spliced M2 or unspliced M1 transcripts (all encoding late proteins) showed a strong requirement for NXF1, while intronless early gene mRNAs, especially NP mRNA, showed the least dependency. Depletion of Aly had little effect on viral mRNA export, but reduction of UAP56 levels strongly inhibited trafficking and/or translation of the M1, M2 and NS1 mRNAs. Synthesis of NS2 from the spliced segment 8 transcript was, however, resistant. We conclude that influenza A virus co-opts the main cellular mRNA export pathway for a subset of its mRNAs, including most but not all late gene transcripts.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) uses the low pH in late endocytic vacuoles as a cue for penetration by membrane fusion. Here, we analyzed the prefusion reactions that prepare the core for uncoating after it has been delivered to the cytosol. We found that this priming process occurs in two steps that are mediated by the envelope-embedded M2 ion channel. The first weakens the interactions between the matrix protein, M1, and the viral ribonucleoprotein bundle. It involves a conformational change in a linker sequence and the C-terminal domain of M1 after exposure to a pH below 6.5. The second step is triggered by a pH of <6.0 and by the influx of K(+) ions. It causes additional changes in M1 as well as a loss of stability in the viral ribonucleoprotein bundle. Our results indicate that both the switch from Na(+) to K(+) in maturing endosomes and the decreasing pH are needed to prime IAV cores for efficient uncoating and infection of the host cell. IMPORTANCE: The entry of IAV involves several steps, including endocytosis and fusion at late endosomes. Entry also includes disassembly of the viral core, which is composed of the viral ribonucleoproteins and the RNA genome. We have found that the uncoating process of IAV is initiated long before the core is delivered into the cytosol. M2, an ion channel in the viral membrane, is activated when the virus passes through early endosomes. Here, we show that protons entering the virus through M2 cause a conformational change in the matrix protein, M1. This weakens interactions between M1 and the viral ribonucleoproteins. A second change was found to occur when the virus enters late endosomes. The preacidified core is then exposed to a high concentration of K(+), which affects the interactions between the ribonucleoproteins. Thus, when cores are finally delivered to the cytosol, they are already partially destabilized and, therefore, uncoating competent and infectious.},

Most of the in vitro cRNA is large (approximately 2.5 X 10(5) to 10(6) daltons), similar in size to in vivo cRNA. The in vitro transcripts initiate in adenosine (A) or guanosine (G) at the 5' end, as also appears to be the case with in vivo cRNA (R.M. Krug et al., 1976). The in vitro transcripts contain covalently linked polyadenylate [poly(A)] sequences, which are longer and more heterogeneous than the poly(A) sequences found on in vivo cRNA. The synthesis in vitro of cRNA with these characteristics requires both the proper divalent cation, Mg2+, and a specific dinulceside monophosphage (DNMP), ApG or GpG. These DNMPs stimulate cRNA synthesis about 100-fold in the presence of Mg2+ and act as primers to initiate RNA chains, as demonstrated by the fact that the 5'-phosphorylated derivatives of these DNMP's, 32pApG or 32pGpG, are incroporated at the 5' end of the product RNA. The RNA synthesized in vitro differs from in vivo cRNA in that neither capping nor methylation of the in vitro transcripts has been detected.

The injected vRNPs were found to be imported into the nucleus, and the RNA was transcribed. Their uptake into the nucleus was ATP-dependent, inhibited by antibodies to the nuclear pore complex, unaffected by the prior acidification of the vRNPs, and not inhibited by amantadine. The results showed that for productive infection, all the early stages of the viral entry pathway (receptor interaction, endocytosis, acid exposure, and membrane fusion) can be bypassed. Once the vRNPs are stripped of M1 and separated from each other, they are competent for import into the nucleus by constitutive cellular processes. Second, the results showed that while the amantadine block for incoming virus is manifested at the level of nuclear entry of the vRNPs, the actual import event per se is not affected. The results are consistent with a recent hypothesis that amantadine inhibits a step needed to prime the core for uncoating, which takes place before the virus has reached the cytosol.},

abstract = {Influenza viruses vary markedly in their efficiency of human-to-human transmission. This variation has been speculated to be determined in part by the tropism of influenza virus for the human upper respiratory tract. To study this tropism, we determined the pattern of virus attachment by virus histochemistry of three human and three avian influenza viruses in human nasal septum, conchae, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, and larynx. We found that the human influenza viruses-two seasonal influenza viruses and pandemic H1N1 virus-attached abundantly to ciliated epithelial cells and goblet cells throughout the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, the avian influenza viruses, including the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, attached only rarely to epithelial cells or goblet cells. Both human and avian viruses attached occasionally to cells of the submucosal glands. The pattern of virus attachment was similar among the different sites of the human upper respiratory tract for each virus tested. We conclude that influenza viruses that are transmitted efficiently among humans attach abundantly to human upper respiratory tract, whereas inefficiently transmitted influenza viruses attach rarely. These results suggest that the ability of an influenza virus to attach to human upper respiratory tract is a critical factor for efficient transmission in the human population.},

We have identified a sequence in HA that has a high propensity for forming a coiled coil. Surprisingly, this sequence corresponds to a loop region in the X-ray structure of native HA: the loop is followed by a three-stranded, coiled-coil stem. We find that a 36 residue peptide (LOOP-36), comprising the loop region and the first part of the stem, forms a three-stranded coiled coil. This coiled coil is extended and stabilized in a longer peptide, corresponding to LOOP-36 plus the residues of a preceding, short ?? helix. These findings lead to a model for the fusogenic conformation of HA: the coiled-coil stem of the native state extends, relocating the hydrophobic fusion peptide, by 100 ??, toward the target membrane.},

The influenza virus genome consists of single-stranded RNAs and exists as viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. After the replication of vRNP in the nucleus, it is exported to the cytoplasm and then reaches the budding site beneath the cell surface in a process mediated by Rab11a-positive recycling endosomes along microtubules. However, the regulatory mechanisms of the postreplicational processes of vRNP are largely unknown. Here we identified, as a novel vRNP-interacting protein, Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1), a cellular protein that is involved in regulation of cellular transcription and translation. YB-1 translocated to the nucleus from the cytoplasm and accumulated in PML nuclear bodies in response to influenza virus infection. vRNP assembled into the exporting complexes with YB-1 at PML nuclear bodies. After nuclear export, using YB-1 knockdown cells and in vitro reconstituted systems, YB-1 was shown to be required for the interaction of vRNP exported from the nucleus with microtubules around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), where Rab11a-positive recycling endosomes were located. Further, we also found that YB-1 overexpression stimulates the production of progeny virions in an Rab11a-dependent manner. Taking these findings together, we propose that YB-1 is a porter that leads vRNP to microtubules from the nucleus and puts it into the vesicular trafficking system.},

abstract = {Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, possesses receptor-destroying activity and thereby facilitates virus release from the cell surface. Among the influenza A viruses, both the cytoplasmic tail (CT) and transmembrane domain (TMD) amino acid sequences of NA are highly conserved, yet their function(s) in virus biology remains unknown. To investigate the role of amino acid sequences of the CT and TMD on the virus life cycle, we systematically mutagenized the entire CT and TMD of NA by converting two to five contiguous amino acids to alanine. In addition, we also made two chimeric NA by replacing the CT proximal one-third amino acids of the NA TMD [NA(1T2N)NA] and the entire NA TMD (NATRNA) with that of human transferrin receptor (TR) (a type II transmembrane glycoprotein). We rescued transfectant mutant viruses by reverse genetics and examined their phenotypes. Our results show that all mutated and chimeric NAs could be rescued into transfectant viruses. Different mutants showed pleiotropic effects on virus growth and replication. Some mutants (NA2A5, NA3A7, and NA4A10) had little effect on virus growth while others (NA3A2, NA5A27, and NA5A31) produced about 50- to 100-fold-less infectious virus and still some others (NA5A14, NA4A19, and NA4A23) exhibited an intermediate phenotype. In general, mutations towards the ectodomain-proximal sequences of TMD progressively caused reduction in NA enzyme activity, affected lipid raft association, and attenuated virus growth. Electron microscopic analysis showed that these mutant viruses remained aggregated and bound to infected cell surfaces and could be released from the infected cells by bacterial NA treatment. Moreover, viruses containing mutations in the extreme N terminus of the CT (NA3A2) as well as chimeric NA containing the TMD replaced partially [NA(1T2N)NA] or fully (NATRNA) with TR TMD caused reduction in virus growth and exhibited the morphological phenotype of elongated particles. These results show that although the sequences of NA CT and TMD per se are not absolutely essential for the virus life cycle, specific amino acid sequences play a critical role in providing structural stability, enzyme activity, and lipid raft association of NA. In addition, aberrant morphogenesis including elongated particle formation of some mutant viruses indicates the involvement of NA in virus morphogenesis and budding.},

Moreover, the virus causes outbreaks in poultry and other animals, such as pigs, requiring costly and laborious countermeasures. Therefore, influenza virus has a substantial impact on health and the global economy. Here, we review entry of this important pathogen into target cells, an essential process by which viral genomes are delivered from extracellular virions to sites of transcription/replication in the cell nucleus. We summarize current knowledge on the interaction of influenza viruses with their receptor, sialic acid, and highlight the ongoing search for additional receptors. We describe receptor-mediated endocytosis and the recently discovered macropinocytosis as alternative virus uptake pathways, and illustrate the subsequent endosomal trafficking of the virus with advanced live microscopy techniques. Release of virus from the endosome and import of the viral ribonucleoproteins into the host cell nucleus are also outlined. Although a focus has been on viral protein function during entry, recent studies have revealed exciting information on cellular factors required for influenza virus entry. We highlight these, and discuss established entry inhibitors targeting viral and host factors, as well as the latest prospects for designing novel 'anti-entry' compounds. New entry inhibitors are of particular importance for current efforts to develop the next generation of anti-influenza drugs - entry is the first essential step of virus replication and is an ideal target to block infection efficiently.},

The polymerase PB2 subunit binds the 5' cap of host pre-mRNAs, which are cleaved after 10-13 nucleotides by the PB1 subunit. Using a library-screening method, we identified an independently folded domain of PB2 that has specific cap binding activity. The X-ray structure of the domain with bound cap analog m(7)GTP at 2.3-A resolution reveals a previously unknown fold and a mode of ligand binding that is similar to, but distinct from, other cap binding proteins. Binding and functional studies with point mutants confirm that the identified site is essential for cap binding in vitro and cap-dependent transcription in vivo by the trimeric polymerase complex. These findings clarify the nature of the cap binding site in PB2 and will allow efficient structure-based design of new anti-influenza compounds inhibiting viral transcription.},

abstract = {Four consensus sequences are conserved with the same linear arrangement in RNA-dependent DNA polymerases encoded by retroid elements and in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases encoded by plus-, minus- and double-strand RNA viruses. One of these motifs corresponds to the YGDD span previously described by Kamer and Argos (1984). These consensus sequences altogether lead to 4 strictly and 18 conservatively maintained amino acids embedded in a large domain of 120 to 210 amino acids. As judged from secondary structure predictions, each of the 4 motifs, which may cooperate to form a well-ordered domain, places one invariant amino acid in or proximal to turn structures that may be crucial for their correct positioning in a catalytic process. We suggest that this domain may constitute a prerequisite 'polymerase module' implicated in template seating and polymerase activity. At the evolutionary level, the sequence similarities, gap distribution and distances between each motif strongly suggest that the ancestral polymerase module was encoded by an individual genetic element which was most closely related to the plus-strand RNA viruses and the non-viral retroposons. This polymerase module gene may have subsequently propagated in the viral kingdom by distinct gene set recombination events leading to the wide viral variety observed today.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus (IAV) neuraminidase (NA) cleaves sialic acids (Sias) from glycans. Inhibiting NA with oseltamivir suppresses both viral infection, and viral release from cultured human airway epithelial cells. The role of NA in viral exit is well established: it releases budding virions by cleaving Sias from glycoconjugates on infected cells and progeny virions. The role of NA in viral entry remains unclear. Host respiratory epithelia secrete a mucus layer rich in heavily sialylated glycoproteins; these could inhibit viral entry by mimicking sialylated receptors on the cell surface. It has been suggested that NA allows influenza to penetrate the mucus by cleaving these sialylated decoys, but the exact mechanism is not yet established.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We tested IAV interaction with secreted mucus using frozen human trachea/bronchus tissue sections, and bead-bound purified human salivary mucins (HSM) and purified porcine submaxillary mucins (PSM). The protective effect of mucus was analyzed using MDCK cells coated with purified HSM and PSM with known Sia content. Oseltamivir was used to inhibit NA activity, and the fluorescent reporter substrate, 4MU-Neu5Ac, was used to quantify NA activity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: IAV binds to the secreted mucus layer of frozen human trachea/bronchus tissues in a Sia dependent manner. HSM inhibition of IAV infection is Sia dose-dependent, but PSM cannot inhibit infection of underlying cells. HSM competitively inhibits NA cleavage of 4MU-Neu5Ac, reporter substrate. Human IAV effectively cleaves Sias from HSM but not from PSM, and binds to HSM but not to PSM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: IAV interacts with human mucus on frozen tissue sections and mucus-coated beads. Inhibition of IAV infection by sialylated human mucus is dose-dependent, and enhanced when NA is inhibited with oseltamivir. Thus NA cleaves sialylated decoys during initial stages of infection. Understanding IAV interactions with host mucins is a promising new avenue for drug development.},

Following receptor binding, influenza viruses are internalized through multiple endocytic pathways, including both clathrin- and non-clathrin-dependent routes, which have recently been visualized at single viral particle level.

Here, RNPs colocalized with Rab11, a pericentriolar recycling endosome marker. Cytoplasmic RNP localization was perturbed by inhibitors of vesicular trafficking, microtubules, or the short interfering RNA-mediated depletion of Rab11. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged RNPs in living cells demonstrated rapid, bidirectional, and saltatory movement, which is characteristic of microtubule-based transport, and also cotrafficked with fluorescent Rab11.

For some time, it has been believed that the low pH in endosomes may, in some way, trigger the capsid disassembly events necessary for nuclear transport. This report provides direct evidence that the association of M1 with vRNPs is sensitive to mildly acidic pH within the infected cell. Recombinant M1, expressed in cultured cells, was found to associate with vRNPs and inhibit their nuclear import. Brief acidification of the cytosolic compartment eliminated the interfering activity and allowed the incoming vRNPs to enter the nucleus. Newly assembled progeny M1-vRNP complexes in the cytosol of infected cells were also dissociated by brief acidification. Acidic pH was thus found to serve as a switch that allowed M1 to carry out its multiple functions in the uncoating, nuclear transport, and assembly of vRNPs.},

We also showed that the upstream sequence at the 5' end is not involved in polyadenylation and that the optimal distance between the 5' end and the U stretch is 16 nucleotides. The combination of these features defines the polyadenylation site and differentiates this signal from other U stretches scattered throughout the genomes of influenza viruses.},

abstract = {The flow of genetic information from sites of transcription within the nucleus to the cytoplasmic translational machinery of eukaryotic cells is obstructed by a physical blockade, the nuclear double membrane, which must be overcome in order to adhere to the central dogma of molecular biology, DNA makes RNA makes protein. Advancement in the field of cellular and molecular biology has painted a detailed picture of the molecular mechanisms from transcription of genes to mRNAs and their processing that is closely coupled to export from the nucleus. The rules that govern delivering messenger transcripts from the nucleus must be obeyed by influenza A virus, a member of the Orthomyxoviridae that has adopted a nuclear replication cycle. The negative-sense genome of influenza A virus is segmented into eight individual viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes containing the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and single-stranded RNA encapsidated in viral nucleoprotein. Influenza A virus mRNAs fall into three major categories, intronless, intron-containing unspliced and spliced. During evolutionary history, influenza A virus has conceived a way of negotiating the passage of viral transcripts from the nucleus to cytoplasmic sites of protein synthesis. The major mRNA nuclear export NXF1 pathway is increasingly implicated in viral mRNA export and this review considers and discusses the current understanding of how influenza A virus exploits the host mRNA export pathway for replication.},

abstract = {The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) is sorted to the apical membrane in polarized epithelial cells and associates with detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). By systematic mutagenesis of the transmembrane residues, we show that hemagglutinin requires 10 contiguous transmembrane amino acids to enter detergent-resistant membranes and that the surface of the trimeric hemagglutinin transmembrane domain facing the lipid environment as well as that facing the interior of the trimer is important for stable association with detergent-resistant membranes. However, association with detergent-resistant membranes was not required for apical sorting. MAL/VIP17 is a protein that is required for apical transport and a small fraction of hemagglutinin co-precipitates with MAL. Mutations that prevented HA from being isolated in detergent-resistant membranes decreased co-precipitation with MAL. The hemagglutinin and MAL that co-precipitated were contained in a detergent-resistant vesicle. However, most of the co-precipitation of newly synthesized hemagglutinin with MAL occurred only after the majority of hemagglutinin reached the cell surface. Both the timing and the limited extent of co-precipitation suggest that the majority of vesicles containing hemagglutinin and MAL are not the detergent-resistant membrane transport intermediates carrying hemagglutinin from the TGN to the apical surface.},

abstract = {The influenza A viruses genome comprises eight single-stranded RNA segments of negative polarity. Each one is included in a ribonucleoprotein particle (vRNP) containing the polymerase complex and a number of nucleoprotein (NP) monomers. Viral RNA replication proceeds by formation of a complementary RNP of positive polarity (cRNP) that serves as intermediate to generate many progeny vRNPs. Transcription initiation takes place by a cap-snatching mechanism whereby the polymerase steals a cellular capped oligonucleotide and uses it as primer to copy the vRNP template. Transcription termination occurs prematurely at the polyadenylation signal, which the polymerase copies repeatedly to generate a 3'-terminal polyA. Here we studied the mechanisms of the viral RNA replication and transcription. We used efficient systems for recombinant RNP transcription/replication in vivo and well-defined polymerase mutants deficient in either RNA replication or transcription to address the roles of the polymerase complex present in the template RNP and newly synthesised polymerase complexes during replication and transcription. The results of trans-complementation experiments showed that soluble polymerase complexes can synthesise progeny RNA in trans and become incorporated into progeny vRNPs, but only transcription in cis could be detected. These results are compatible with a new model for virus RNA replication, whereby a template RNP would be replicated in trans by a soluble polymerase complex and a polymerase complex distinct from the replicative enzyme would direct the encapsidation of progeny vRNA. In contrast, transcription of the vRNP would occur in cis and the resident polymerase complex would be responsible for mRNA synthesis and polyadenylation.},

We identify the amino acid sequences that constitute these two active sites and demonstrate that they are located on different polymerase subunits. Binding of the 5' terminal sequence of virion RNA (vRNA) to the polymerase activates a tryptophan-rich, cap-binding sequence on the PB2 subunit. At least one of the tryptophans functions in cap binding, indicating that this active site is probably similar to that of other known cap-binding proteins. Endonuclease cleavage, which is activated by the subsequent binding of the 3' terminal sequence of vRNA, resides in a PB1 sequence that contains three essential acidic amino acids, similar to the active sites of other enzymes that cut polynucleotides to produce 3'-OH ends. These results, coupled with those of our previous study, provide a molecular map of the five known essential active sites of the influenza viral polymerase.},

It has been shown that PB1-F2 contributes to viral pathogenicity, although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Induction of type I interferon (IFN) and the innate immune response are the first line of defense against viral infection. Here we show that influenza A viruses (IAVs) lacking the PB1-F2 protein induce an enhanced expression of IFN-$\beta$ and IFN-stimulated genes in infected epithelial cells. Studying molecular mechanisms underlying the PB1-F2-mediated IFN antagonistic activity showed that PB1-F2 interferes with the RIG-I/MAVS protein complex thereby inhibiting the activation of the downstream transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3. These findings were also reflected in in vivo studies demonstrating that infection with PR8 wild-type (wt) virus resulted in higher lung titers and a more severe onset of disease compared with infection with its PB1-F2-deficient counterpart. Accordingly, a much more pronounced infiltration of lungs with immune cells was detected in mice infected with the PB1-F2 wt virus. In summary, we demonstrate that the PB1-F2 protein of IAVs exhibits a type I IFN-antagonistic function by interfering with the RIG-I/MAVS complex, which contributes to an enhanced pathogenicity in vivo.},

To define the nuclear signal of the NS1 protein, a series of recombinant simian virus 40 vectors that express deletion mutants or fusion proteins was constructed. Analysis of the proteins expressed resulted in identification of two regions of the NS1 protein which affect its cellular location. Nuclear localization signal 1 (NLS1) contains the stretch of basic amino acids Asp-Arg-Leu-Arg-Arg (codons 34 to 38). This sequence is conserved in all NS1 proteins of influenza A viruses, as well as in that of influenza B viruses. NLS2 is defined within the region between amino acids 203 and 237. This domain is present in the NS1 proteins of most influenza A virus strains. NLS1 and NLS2 contain basic amino acids and are similar to previously defined nuclear signal sequences of other proteins.},

Mutation of residues E190 and S228 that are in positions to form hydrogen bonds with the 9-OH of sialic acid appeared to increase erythrocyte binding slightly, as did the substitution G225R. Substitutions of other residues that are directly or indirectly involved in receptor binding, S136T, S136A, Y195F, G225D, and L226P, had intermediate effects on binding between these two extremes. Estimates of changes in receptor binding specificity based on inhibition of binding to erythrocytes by nonimmune horse sera indicated that mutants G225R and L226P, unlike wild-type HA, were not inhibited; Y195F and G225D mutants were, like wild type, inhibited; and erythrocyte binding by mutants S136A, S136T, E190A, and S228G was only partially inhibited. Viruses containing mutant HAs Y98F, S136T, G225D, and S228G that cover the range of erythrocyte binding properties observed were also constructed by transfection. All four transfectant viruses replicated in MDCK cells and embryonated hens' eggs as efficiently as wild-type X-31 virus, although the Y98F mutant virus was unable to agglutinate erythrocytes.

We found that the influenza viral NP behaves like a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) containing protein. Thus, at 0 degrees C it docks at the nuclear envelope only in the presence of the heterodimeric karyopherin (either karyopherin alpha 1 beta or karyopherin alpha 2 beta), and docking is competitively inhibited by an unlabeled NLS containing substrate. Like other NLS-containing proteins, at 20 degrees C NP is imported into the nucleus after further addition of the GTPase Ran and of p10. In contrast, the fluorescently labeled, 890-nucleotide-long viral RNA segment does not dock to the nuclear envelope or enter the nucleus either in the presence of exogenous cytosol or of karyopherin heterodimer, Ran, and p10. However, in the presence of NP the RNA is able to dock and enter the nucleus with transport requirements indistinguishable from those for docking and entry of NP. These data indicate that uptake of the influenza virus RNA segment is not via a signal in the RNA but via an NLS of a viral protein such as NP.},

Transfection of fluorescent-labeled antibody and subsequent live cell imaging revealed that punctate vRNP signals moved along microtubules rapidly but intermittently in both directions, suggestive of vesicle trafficking. Using a series of Rab family protein, we demonstrated that progeny vRNP localized to recycling endosome (RE) in an active/GTP-bound Rab11-dependent manner. The vRNP interacted with Rab11 through viral RNA polymerase. The localization of vRNP to RE and subsequent accumulation to the APM were impaired by overexpression of Rab binding domains (RBD) of Rab11 family interacting proteins (Rab11-FIPs). Similarly, no APM accumulation was observed by overexpression of class II Rab11-FIP mutants lacking RBD. These results suggest that the progeny vRNP makes use of Rab11-dependent RE machinery for APM trafficking.},

When these mutant and chimeric proteins were expressed in stably transfected polarized MDCK cells, the transmembrane domain of NA, and not the cytoplasmic tail, provided a determinant for apical targeting in polarized MDCK cells and this transmembrane signal was sufficient for sorting and transport of the ectodomain of a reporter protein (transferrin receptor) directly to the apical plasma membrane of polarized MDCK cells. In addition, by using differential detergent extraction, we demonstrated that influenza virus NA and the chimeras which were transported to the apical plasma membrane also became insoluble in Triton X-100 but soluble in octylglucoside after extraction from MDCK cells during exocytic transport.

abstract = {The entry of fowl plague virus, and avian influenza A virus, into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was examined both biochemically and morphologically. At low multiplicity and 0 degrees C, viruses bound to the cell surface but were not internalized. Binding was not greatly dependent on the pH of the medium and reached an equilibrium level in 60-90 min. Over 90\% of the bound viruses were removed by neuraminidase but not by proteases. When cells with prebound virus were warmed to 37 degrees C, part of the virus became resistant to removal b neuraminidase, with a half-time of 10-15 min. After a brief lag period, degraded viral material was released into the medium. The neuraminidase-resistant virus was capable of infecting the cells and probably did so by an intracellular route, since ammonium chloride, a lysosomotropic agent, blocked both the infection and the degradation of viral protein. When the entry process was observed by electron microscopy, viruses were seen bound primarily to microvilli on the cell surface at 0 degrees C and, after warming at 37 degrees C, were endocytosed in coated pits, coated vesicles, and large smooth-surfaced vacuoles. Viruses were also present in smooth-surfaced invaginations and small smooth-surfaced vesicles at both temperatures. At physiological pH, no fusion of the virus with the plasma membrane was observed. When prebound virus was incubated at a pH of 5.5 or below for 1 min at 37 degrees C, fusion was, however, detected by ferritin immunolabeling. t low multiplicity, 90\% of the prebound virus became neuraminidase-resistant and was presumably fused after only 30 s at low pH. These experiments suggest that fowl plague virus enters MDCK cells by endocytosis in coated pits and coated vesicles and is transported to the lysosome where the low pH initiates a fusion reaction ultimately resulting in the transfer of the genome into the cytoplasm. The entry pathway of fowl plague virus thus resembles tht earlier described for Semliki Forest virus.},

abstract = {Dynamic studies of influenza virus infection in the live cells are limited because of the lack of appropriate methods for non-invasive detection of the viral components. Using the split-GFP strategy, we have recently developed and characterized an unimpaired recombinant influenza A virus encoding a tagged PB2 subunit of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which enabled continuous real-time visualization of the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) in living cells (Avilov, Moisy, Munier, Schraidt, Naffakh and Cusack [12]). Here, using this virus, we studied vRNP trafficking and interaction with Rab11 in the context of quasi-wild type infection. In agreement with recent reports, we observed that upon nuclear export, progeny vRNPs accumulate in the particles containing Rab11, a multifunctional protein involved in vesicle trafficking which resides at recycling endosomes. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy indicated a distance <10. nm between PB2 and Rab11, suggesting that a direct interaction occurs. Single particle tracking analysis showed that most of the motions of vRNP-positive particles in infected cells are slow, while rapid directional motions intermittently occur. Analysis focused on these intermittent motions indicated that depolymerization of either microtubules or actin filaments moderately reduced their occurrence, while disruption of both cytoskeleton components in combination suppressed the rapid motions entirely. Thus, the split-GFP based virus enabled us to obtain a live-cell based confirmation for the model of vRNP trafficking which assumes accumulation of vRNP in recycling endosomes through a direct interaction of PB2 with Rab11, and subsequent transport across the cytoplasm involving microtubules and actin filaments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

These viruses possess segmented, negative stranded RNA genomes (vRNA) and are enveloped, usually spherical and bud from the plasma membrane (more specifically, the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells). Complete virus particles, therefore, are not found inside infected cells. Virus particles consist of three major subviral components, namely the viral envelope, matrix protein (M1), and core (viral ribonucleocapsid [vRNP]). The viral envelope surrounding the vRNP consists of a lipid bilayer containing spikes composed of viral glycoproteins (HA, NA, and M2) on the outer side and M1 on the inner side. Viral lipids, derived from the host plasma membrane, are selectively enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. M1 forms the bridge between the viral envelope and the core. The viral core consists of helical vRNP containing vRNA (minus strand) and NP along with minor amounts of NEP and polymerase complex (PA, PB1, and PB2). For viral morphogenesis to occur, all three viral components, namely the viral envelope (containing lipids and transmembrane proteins), M1, and the vRNP must be brought to the assembly site, i.e. the apical plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells. Finally, buds must be formed at the assembly site and virus particles released with the closure of buds. Transmembrane viral proteins are transported to the assembly site on the plasma membrane via the exocytic pathway. Both HA and NA possess apical sorting signals and use lipid rafts for cell surface transport and apical sorting. These lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and are relatively resistant to neutral detergent extraction at low temperature. M1 is synthesized on free cytosolic polyribosomes. vRNPs are made inside the host nucleus and are exported into the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore with the help of M1 and NEP. How M1 and vRNPs are directed to the assembly site on the plasma membrane remains unclear. The likely possibilities are that they use a piggy-back mechanism on viral glycoproteins or cytoskeletal elements. Alternatively, they may possess apical determinants or diffuse to the assembly site, or a combination of these pathways. Interactions of M1 with M1, M1 with vRNP, and M1 with HA and NA facilitate concentration of viral components and exclusion of host proteins from the budding site. M1 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail (CT) and transmembrane domain (TMD) of glycoproteins, and thereby functions as a bridge between the viral envelope and vRNP. Lipid rafts function as microdomains for concentrating viral glycoproteins and may serve as a platform for virus budding. Virus bud formation requires membrane bending at the budding site. A combination of factors including concentration of and interaction among viral components, increased viscosity and asymmetry of the lipid bilayer of the lipid raft as well as pulling and pushing forces of viral and host components are likely to cause outward curvature of the plasma membrane at the assembly site leading to bud formation. Eventually, virus release requires completion of the bud due to fusion of the apposing membranes, leading to the closure of the bud, separation of the virus particle from the host plasma membrane and release of the virus particle into the extracellular environment. Among the viral components, M1 contains an L domain motif and plays a critical role in budding. Bud completion requires not only viral components but also host components. However, how host components facilitate bud completion remains unclear. In addition to bud completion, influenza virus requires NA to release virus particles from sialic acid residues on the cell surface and spread from cell to cell. Elucidation of both viral and host factors involved in viral morphogenesis and budding may lead to the development of drugs interfering with the steps of viral morphogenesis and in disease progression. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The PA(N) structure has an alpha/beta architecture and reveals a bound magnesium ion coordinated by a motif similar to the (P)DX(N)(D/E)XK motif characteristic of many endonucleases. Structural comparisons and mutagenesis analysis of the motif identified in PA(N) provide further evidence that PA(N) holds an endonuclease active site. Furthermore, functional analysis with in vivo ribonucleoprotein reconstitution and direct in vitro endonuclease assays strongly suggest that PA(N) holds the endonuclease active site and has critical roles in endonuclease activity of the influenza virus polymerase, rather than PB1. The high conservation of this endonuclease active site among influenza strains indicates that PA(N) is an important target for the design of new anti-influenza therapeutics.},

abstract = {Sialic acid has long been considered to be the sole receptor for influenza virus. The viral hemagglutinin (HA) is known to bind cell surface sialic acid, and sialic acids on viral glyco-proteins are cleaved by the viral neuraminidase (NA) to promote efficient release of progeny virus particles. However, NWS-Mvi, a mutant virus completely lacking NA, grows well in MDCK cells continuously treated with exogenous neuraminidase (sialidase). Exogenous sialidase quantitatively releases all sialic acids from purified glycoproteins and glycolipids of MDCK cells and efficiently removes surface sialic acid from intact cells. Binding of NWS-Mvi and parent influenza viruses to MDCK cells is indistinguishable, and is only partially reduced by sialidase treatment of the cells. Both mutant and wild-type viruses enter enzymatically desialylated cells and initiate transcription. The ability of influenza A reassortant viruses to infect desialylated cells is shared by recent H3N2 clinical isolates, suggesting that this may be a general property of influenza A viruses. We propose that influenza virus infection can result from sialic acid-independent receptors, either directly or in a multistage process. When sialic acid is present, it may act to enhance virus binding to the cell surface to increase interaction with secondary receptors to mediate entry. Understanding virus entry will be critical to further efforts in infection control and prevention.},

abstract = {The Influenza A virus genome consists of eight negative sense, single-stranded RNA segments. Although it has been established that most virus particles contain a single copy of each of the eight viral RNAs, the packaging selection mechanism remains poorly understood. Influenza viral RNAs are synthesized in the nucleus, exported into the cytoplasm and travel to the plasma membrane where viral budding and genome packaging occurs. Due to the difficulties in analyzing associated vRNPs while preserving information about their positions within the cell, it has remained unclear how and where during cellular trafficking the viral RNAs of different segments encounter each other. Using a multicolor single-molecule sensitivity fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) approach, we have quantitatively monitored the colocalization of pairs of influenza viral RNAs in infected cells. We found that upon infection, the viral RNAs from the incoming particles travel together until they reach the nucleus. The viral RNAs were then detected in distinct locations in the nucleus; they are then exported individually and initially remain separated in the cytoplasm. At later time points, the different viral RNA segments gather together in the cytoplasm in a microtubule independent manner. Viral RNAs of different identities colocalize at a high frequency when they are associated with Rab11 positive vesicles, suggesting that Rab11 positive organelles may facilitate the association of different viral RNAs. Using engineered influenza viruses lacking the expression of HA or M2 protein, we showed that these viral proteins are not essential for the colocalization of two different viral RNAs in the cytoplasm. In sum, our smFISH results reveal that the viral RNAs travel together in the cytoplasm before their arrival at the plasma membrane budding sites. This newly characterized step of the genome packaging process demonstrates the precise spatiotemporal regulation of the infection cycle.},

abstract = {Influenza virus assembly and morphogenesis require transport of viral components to the assembly site at the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells and interaction among the viral components. In this report we have discussed the apical determinants present in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and the interaction of M1 with influenza virus HA and NA. Earlier studies have shown that the NA and HA TMDs possess determinant(s) for apical sorting and raft-association (Kundu et al., 1996. J. Virol 70, 6508-6515; Lin et al., 1998. J. Cell Biol. 142, 51-57). Analysis of chimeric constructs between NA and TR (human transferring receptor) TMDs and the mutations in the NA and HA TMD sequences showed that the COOH terminus of the NA TMD and NH(2) terminus of the HA TMD encompassing the exoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayers were significantly involved in lipid raft-association and that apical determinants were not discrete sequences but rather dispersed within the TMD of HA and NA. These analyses also showed that although both signals for apical sorting and raft-association resided in the NA TMD, they were not identical and varied independently. Interactions of M1 protein with HA or NA, the influenza virus envelope glycoproteins, were investigated by TX-100 detergent treatment of membrane fractions and floatation in sucrose gradients. Results from these analyses showed that the interaction of M1 with mature HA and NA, which associated with the detergent-resistant lipid rafts caused an increased detergent-resistance of the membrane-bound M1 and that M1 interacted with HA and NA both in influenza virus-infected cells as well as in recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cells coexpressing M1 with HA and/or NA. Furthermore, both the cytoplasmic tail and the TMD of HA caused an increased detergent-resistance of the membrane-bound M1 supporting their interaction with M1. Immunofluorescence analysis by confocal microscopy also showed colocalization supporting the interaction of M1 with HA and NA at the cell surface and during exocytic transport both in influenza virus-infected cells as well as in coexpressing cells.},

abstract = {The M2 protein of influenza A virus is a small, nonglycosylated transmembrane protein that is expressed on surfaces of virus-infected cells. A monoclonal antibody specific for the M2 protein was used to investigate its expression in polarized epithelial cells infected with influenza virus or a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses M2. The expression of M2 on the surfaces of influenza virus-infected cells was found to be restricted to the apical surface, closely paralleling that of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). Membrane domain-specific immunoprecipitation indicated that the M2 protein was inserted directly into the apical membrane with transport kinetics similar to those of HA. In polarized cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses M2, we found that 86 to 93\% of surface M2 was restricted to the apical domain compared with 88 to 90\% of HA in a similar assay. These results indicate that the M2 protein undergoes directional transport in the absence of other influenza virus proteins and that M2 contains the structural features required for apical transport in polarized epithelial cells. The ultrastructural localization of the M2 protein in influenza virus-infected MDCK cells was investigated by immunoelectron microscopy using M2 antibody and a gold conjugate. In cells in which extensive virus budding was occurring, the apical cell membrane was labeled with gold particles evenly distributed between microvilli and the surrounding membrane. In addition, a significant fraction of the M2 label was apparently associated with virions. A monoclonal antibody specific for HA demonstrated a similar labeling pattern. These results indicate that M2 is localized in close proximity to budding and assembled virions.},

abstract = {Replication of the RNAs of influenza virus occurs in the nucleus of infected cells. The nucleoprotein (NP) has been shown to be important for the import of the viral RNA into the nucleus and has been proposed to contain at least three different nuclear localization signals (NLSs). Here, an import assay in digitonin-permeabilized cells was used to further define the contribution of these NLSs. Mutation of the unconventional NLS impaired the nuclear import of the NP. A peptide bearing the unconventional NLS could inhibit the nuclear import of the NP in this import assay and prevent the NP-karyopherin alpha interaction in a binding assay confirming the crucial role of this signal. Interestingly, a peptide containing the SV40 T antigen NLS was unable to inhibit the nuclear import of NP or the NP-karyopherin alpha interaction, suggesting that the NP and the SV40 T antigen do not share a common binding site on karyopherin alpha. We also investigated the question of which NLS(s) is/are necessary for the viral ribonucleoprotein complex to enter the nucleus. We found that the peptide containing the unconventional NLS efficiently inhibited the nuclear import of the ribonucleoprotein complexes. This finding suggests that the unconventional NLS is the major signal necessary not only for the nuclear transport of free NP but also for the import of the ribonucleoprotein complexes. Finally, viral replication could be specifically inhibited by a membrane-permeable peptide containing the unconventional NLS, confirming the crucial role of this signal during the replicative cycle of the virus.},

abstract = {Influenza viral RNA transcription in vitro is primed by capped RNA fragments cleaved from capped RNAs by a viral endonuclease. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the specificities of the viral endonuclease and transcriptase observed in in vitro studies are also observed in the infected cell. The NS (nonstructural) gene of influenza WSN virus was cloned in pBR322 by using a double-stranded DNA containing a cDNA copy of both virion RNA (vRNA) and in vivo viral mRNA. We determined the 5' terminal sequence of the particular NS viral mRNA molecule which was cloned and also the 5' terminal sequences of the entire population of in vivo NS viral mRNAs synthesized in two different cell lines. For the latter determination we used a restriction fragment from the cloned DNA for the reverse transcriptase-catalyzed extension of total in vivo viral mRNA. The results indicate that in vivo and in vitro viral RNA transcription are similar in two important respects: (i) transcription initiates not with an A residue directed by the 3' terminal U of the vRNA, but with a G residue directed by the 3' penultimate C of the vRNA; and (ii) capped RNA fragments containing a 3' terminal A residue are preferentially used as primers, therapy generating an AG sequence in the viral mRNA complementary to the 3' terminal UC of the vRNA. Actually, for in vivo transcription, a subset of A-terminated capped fragments, namely those containing a 3' penultimate C residue, are the preferred primers. The latter specificity had not been observed in previous in vitro studies.},

We identified cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (. CH25H) as a broadly antiviral ISG. CH25H converts cholesterol to a soluble antiviral factor, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). 25HC treatment in cultured cells broadly inhibited growth of enveloped viruses including VSV, HSV, HIV, and MHV68 and acutely pathogenic EBOV, RVFV, RSSEV, and Nipah viruses under BSL4 conditions. It suppressed viral growth by blocking membrane fusion between virus and cell. In animal models, Ch25h-deficient mice were more susceptible to MHV68 lytic infection. Moreover, administration of 25HC in humanized mice suppressed HIV replication and reversed T cell depletion. Thus, our studies demonstrate a unique mechanism by which IFN achieves its antiviral state through the production of a natural oxysterol to inhibit viral entry and implicate membrane-modifying oxysterols as potential antiviral therapeutics. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Davey et al., Cell 40:667-675, 1985). However, some NP mutants that lack this region still localize to the nucleus, suggesting an additional NLS in NP. We therefore investigated the nucleocytoplasmic transport of NP from influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1). NP deletion constructs lacking the 38 N-terminal amino acids, as well as those lacking the 38 N-terminal amino acids and the previously identified NLS, localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Nuclear localization of a protein containing amino acids 1 to 38 of NP fused to LacZ proved that these 38 amino acids function as an NLS. Within this region, we identified two basic amino acids, Lys7 and Arg8, that are crucial for NP nuclear import. After being imported into the nucleus, the wild-type NP and the NP-LacZ fusion construct containing amino acids 1 to 38 of NP were both transported back to the cytoplasm, where they accumulated. These data indicate that NP has intrinsic structural features that allow nuclear import, nuclear export, and cytoplasmic accumulation in the absence of any other viral proteins. Further, the information required for nuclear import and export is located in the 38 N-terminal amino acids of NP, although other NP nuclear export signals may exist. Treatment of cells with a protein kinase C inhibitor increased the amounts of nuclear NP, whereas treatment of cells with a phosphorylation stimulator increased the amounts of cytoplasmic NP. These findings suggest a role of phosphorylation in nucleocytoplasmic transport of NP.},

Increasing the concentration of NaCl reduced M1 binding, but even at a high salt concentration (0.6 M NaCl), approximately 20\% of the input M1 was capable of binding to RNP. Mutations altering potential M1 RNA-binding regions (basic amino acids 101RKLKR105 and the zinc finger motif at amino acids 148 to 162) had varied effect: mutations of amino acids 101 to 105 reduced RNP binding compared to the Wt M1, but mutations of zinc finger motif did not. Treatment of RNP with RNase reduced M1 binding by approximately half, but even M1 mutants lacking RNA-binding regions had residual binding to RNase-treated RNP provided that the N-terminal 76 amino acids of M1 (containing two hydrophobic domains) were intact. Addition of detergent to the reaction mixture further reduced binding related to the N-terminal 76 amino acids and showed the greatest effect for mutations affecting the RNA-binding regions of basic amino acids. The data suggest that M1 interacts with both the RNA and protein components of RNP in assembly and disassembly of influenza A viruses.},

Microinjection and immunoelectron microscopy experiments indicated that the NP entered the nucleus through the nuclear pore as part of an intact ribonucleoprotein (RNP) structure and that its transport was an active process. Transport of the incoming RNPs into the nucleus was not dependent on an intact microfilament, microtubule, or intermediate filament network. Subsequent to penetration, the matrix (M1) protein appeared to dissociate from the RNP structure and to enter the nucleus independently of the RNP.

In this review we focus on the structure of this RNA-synthesis machines and the included RNA polymerase, and on the mechanisms by which they express their genetic information as mRNAs and generate progeny ribonucleoproteins that will become incorporated into new infectious virions. New structural, biochemical and genetic data are rapidly accumulating in this very active area of research. We discuss these results and attempt to integrate the information into structural and functional models that may help the design of new experiments and further our knowledge on virus RNA replication and gene expression. This interplay between structural and functional data will eventually provide new targets for controlled attenuation or antiviral therapy.},

abstract = {Influenza virus transcription is a prototype of primer-dependent initiation. Its replication mechanism is thought to be primer-independent. The internal initiation and realignment model for influenza virus genome replication has been recently proposed (Deng, T., Vreede, F. T., and Brownlee, G. G. (2006) J. Virol. 80, 2337-2348). We obtained new results, which led us to propose a novel model for the initiation of viral RNA (vRNA) replication. In our study, we analyzed the initiation mechanisms of influenza virus vRNA and complementary RNA (cRNA) synthesis in vitro, using purified RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 84-nt model RNA templates. We found that, for vRNA → cRNA →, RdRp initiated replication from the second nucleotide of the 3'-end. Therefore, host RNA-specific ribonucleotidyltransferases are required to add one nucleotide (purine residues are preferred) to the 3'-end of vRNA to make the complete copy of vRNA. This hypothesis was experimentally proven using poly(A) polymerase. For cRNA → vRNA, the dinucleotide primer AG was synthesized from UC (fourth and fifth from the 3'-end) by RdRp pausing at the sixth U of UUU and realigning at the 3'-end of cRNA template; then RdRp was able to read through the entire template RNA. The RdRp initiation complex was not stable until it had read through the UUU of cRNA and the UUUU of vRNA at their respective 3'-ends. This was because primers overlapping with the first U of the clusters did not initiate transcription efficiently, and the initiation product of v84+G (the v84 template with an extra G at its 3'-end), AGC, realigned to the 3'-end.},

abstract = {Interferon-mediated host responses are of great importance for controlling influenza A virus infections. It is well established that the interferon-induced Mx proteins possess powerful antiviral activities toward most influenza viruses. Here we analyzed a range of influenza A virus strains for their sensitivities to murine Mx1 and human MxA proteins and found remarkable differences. Virus strains of avian origin were highly sensitive to Mx1, whereas strains of human origin showed much weaker responses. Artificial reassortments of the viral components in a minireplicon system identified the viral nucleoprotein as the main target structure of Mx1. Interestingly, the recently reconstructed 1918 H1N1 "Spanish flu" virus was much less sensitive than the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain A/Vietnam/1203/04 when tested in a minireplicon system. Importantly, the human 1918 virus-based minireplicon system was almost insensitive to inhibition by human MxA, whereas the avian influenza A virus H5N1-derived system was well controlled by MxA. These findings suggest that Mx proteins provide a formidable hurdle that hinders influenza A viruses of avian origin from crossing the species barrier to humans. They further imply that the observed insensitivity of the 1918 virus-based replicon to the antiviral activity of human MxA is a hitherto unrecognized characteristic of the "Spanish flu" virus that may contribute to the high virulence of this unusual pandemic strain.},

abstract = {Influenza viruses are enveloped, negative stranded, segmented RNA viruses belonging to Orthomyxoviridae family. Each virion consists of three major sub-viral components, namely (i) a viral envelope decorated with three transmembrane proteins hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and M2, (ii) an intermediate layer of matrix protein (M1), and (iii) an innermost helical viral ribonucleocapsid [vRNP] core formed by nucleoprotein (NP) and negative strand viral RNA (vRNA). Since complete virus particles are not found inside the cell, the processes of assembly, morphogenesis, budding and release of progeny virus particles at the plasma membrane of the infected cells are critically important for the production of infectious virions and pathogenesis of influenza viruses as well. Morphogenesis and budding require that all virus components must be brought to the budding site which is the apical plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells whether in vitro cultured cells or in vivo infected animals. HA and NA forming the outer spikes on the viral envelope possess apical sorting signals and use exocytic pathways and lipid rafts for cell surface transport and apical sorting. NP also has apical determinant(s) and is probably transported to the apical budding site similarly via lipid rafts and/or through cortical actin microfilaments. M1 binds the NP and the exposed RNAs of vRNPs, as well as to the cytoplasmic tails (CT) and transmembrane (TM) domains of HA, NA and M2, and is likely brought to the budding site on the piggy-back of vRNP and transmembrane proteins. Budding processes involve bud initiation, bud growth and bud release. The presence of lipid rafts and assembly of viral components at the budding site can cause asymmetry of lipid bilayers and outward membrane bending leading to bud initiation and bud growth. Bud release requires fusion of the apposing viral and cellular membranes and scission of the virus buds from the infected cellular membrane. The processes involved in bud initiation, bud growth and bud scission/release require involvement both viral and host components and can affect bud closing and virus release in both positive and negative ways. Among the viral components, M1, M2 and NA play important roles in bud release and M1, M2 and NA mutations all affect the morphology of buds and released viruses. Disassembly of host cortical actin microfilaments at the pinching-off site appears to facilitate bud fission and release. Bud scission is energy dependent and only a small fraction of virus buds present on the cell surface is released. Discontinuity of M1 layer underneath the lipid bilayer, absence of outer membrane spikes, absence of lipid rafts in the lipid bilayer, as well as possible presence of M2 and disassembly of cortical actin microfilaments at the pinching-off site appear to facilitate bud fission and bud release. We provide our current understanding of these important processes leading to the production of infectious influenza virus particles. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Nuclear export is mediated by the cellular protein Crm1 and putatively by the viral protein NEP/NS2. Proteolytic cleavage of NEP defines an N-terminal domain which mediates RanGTP-dependent binding to Crm1 and a C-terminal domain which binds to the viral matrix protein M1. The 2.6 A crystal structure of the C-terminal domain reveals an amphipathic helical hairpin which dimerizes as a four-helix bundle. The NEP-M1 interaction involves two critical epitopes: an exposed tryptophan (Trp78) surrounded by a cluster of glutamate residues on NEP, and the basic nuclear localization signal (NLS) of M1. Implications for vRNP export are discussed.},

abstract = {Intra-cellular transport and assembly of the subunits of the heterotrimeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a key component of the replication cycle of influenza virus. Recent results suggest that the efficient polymerase assembly is a limiting factor in the viability of reassortant viruses. The mechanism of nuclear import and assembly of the three polymerase subunits, PB1, PB2 and PA, is still controversial, yet clearly of great significance in understanding the emergence of new strains with pandemic potential. In this report, we systematically investigated the interactions between the polymerase subunits and their localization in living cells by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and quantitative confocal microscopy. We could show that PB1 and PA form a dimer in the cytoplasm, which is imported into the nucleus separately from PB2. Once in the nucleus, the PB1/PA dimer associates with PB2 to form the trimeric polymerase. Photon counting histogram analysis revealed that trimeric polymerase complexes can form higher order oligomers in the nucleus. We furthermore demonstrate that impairing the nuclear import of PB2 by mutating its nuclear localization signal leads to the abnormal formation of the trimeric polymerase in the cytoplasm. Taken together, our results demonstrate which of the previously discussed influenza polymerase transport models operates in live cells. Our study sheds light on the interplay between the nuclear import of the subunits and the assembly of the influenza polymerase and provides a methodological framework to analyze the effect of different host range mutations in the future.},

abstract = {Influenza virus has been described to enter host cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, it has also been suggested that other endocytic routes may provide additional entry pathways. Here we show that influenza virus may enter and infect HeLa cells that are unable to take up ligands by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. By overexpressing a dominant-negative form of the Eps15 protein to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we demonstrate that while transferrin uptake and Semliki Forest virus infection were prevented, influenza virus could enter and infect cells expressing Eps15Delta95/295. This finding is supported by the successful infection of cells with influenza virus in the presence of chemical treatments that block endocytosis, namely, chlorpromazine and potassium depletion. We show also that influenza virus may infect cells incapable of uptake by caveolae. Treatment with the inhibitors nystatin, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, and genistein, as well as transfection of cells with dominant-negative caveolin-1, had no effect on influenza virus infection. By combining inhibitory methods to block both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and uptake by caveolae in the same cell, we demonstrate that influenza virus may infect cells by an additional non-clathrin-dependent, non-caveola-dependent endocytic pathway. We believe this to be the first conclusive analysis of virus entry via such a non-clathrin-dependent pathway, in addition to the traditional clathrin-dependent route.},

In this study we have tested the hypothesis that the polarized delivery of these proteins to the plasma membrane involves the operation of a receptor that cycles between the trans Golgi network and the plasma membrane, binding the proteins at low pH in the former compartment and releasing them at normal extracellular pH in the latter. The hypothesis predicts that apical, but not basolateral, low pH would eventually delay or block delivery of the proteins to the plasma membrane. We found that basolateral low pH in fact had the more profound effect, in line with its greater effect on intracellular pH. We conclude that the hypothesis is not valid, and that low extracellular pH causes its effect on protein transport by changing intracellular pH.},

abstract = {In viral cap-snatching, the endonuclease intrinsic to the viral polymerase cleaves cellular capped RNAs to generate capped fragments that are primers for viral mRNA synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the influenza viral polymerase, which is assembled in human cells using recombinant proteins, effectively uses only CA-terminated capped fragments as primers for viral mRNA synthesis in vitro. Thus we provide the first in vitro system that mirrors the cap-snatching process occurring in vivo during virus infection. Further, we demonstrate that when a capped RNA substrate contains a CA cleavage site, the functions of virion RNA (vRNA) differ from those previously described: the 5' terminal sequence of vRNA alone is sufficient for endonuclease activation, and the 3' terminal sequence of vRNA functions solely as a template for mRNA synthesis. Consequently, we are able to identify the vRNA sequences that are required for each of these two separable functions. We present a new model for the influenza virus cap-snatching mechanism, which we postulate is a paradigm for the cap-snatching mechanisms of other segmented, negative-strand and ambisense RNA viruses.},

Each RNA segment is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein and the polymerase complex into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), which are responsible for virus transcription and replication. Despite their importance, information about the structure of these RNPs is scarce. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of a biologically active recombinant RNP by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure shows a nonameric nucleoprotein ring (at 12 Angstrom resolution) with two monomers connected to the polymerase complex (at 18 Angstrom resolution). Docking the atomic structures of the nucleoprotein and polymerase domains, as well as mutational analyses, has allowed us to define the interactions between the functional elements of the RNP and to propose the location of the viral RNA. Our results provide the first model for a functional negative-stranded RNA virus ribonucleoprotein complex. The structure reported here will serve as a framework to generate a quasi-atomic model of the molecular machine responsible for viral RNA synthesis and to test new models for virus RNA replication and transcription.},
