abstract = {The NS1 protein of influenza A virus has the unique property of binding to three apparently different RNAs: poly A; a stem-bulge in U6 small nuclear RNA; and double-stranded RNA. One of our major goals is to determine how the NS1 protein recognizes and binds to its several RNA targets. As the first step for conducting structural studies, we have succeeded in identifying a fragment of the NS1 protein that possesses all the RNA-binding activities of the full-length protein. The RNA-binding fragment consists of the 73 amino-terminal amino acids of the protein. We have developed procedures for obtaining large amounts of the polypeptide in pure form. This has enabled us to establish the RNA-binding properties of this polypeptide and to demonstrate that it retains the ability to dimerize exhibited by the full-length protein. In addition, far-UV CD spectroscopy indicates that this RNA-binding polypeptide is largely (approximately 80\%) helical, suggesting that the mode of dimerization of the NS1 protein and of its interaction with RNA is mediated, at least in part, by helices.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus NS1 protein is a multifunctional virulence factor consisting of an RNA binding domain (RBD), a short linker, an effector domain (ED), and a C-terminal 'tail'. Although poorly understood, NS1 multimerization may autoregulate its actions. While RBD dimerization seems functionally conserved, two possible apo ED dimers have been proposed (helix-helix and strand-strand). Here, we analyze all available RBD, ED, and full-length NS1 structures, including four novel crystal structures obtained using EDs from divergent human and avian viruses, as well as two forms of a monomeric ED mutant. The data reveal the helix-helix interface as the only strictly conserved ED homodimeric contact. Furthermore, a mutant NS1 unable to form the helix-helix dimer is compromised in its ability to bind dsRNA efficiently, implying that ED multimerization influences RBD activity. Our bioinformatical work also suggests that the helix-helix interface is variable and transient, thereby allowing two ED monomers to twist relative to one another and possibly separate. In this regard, we found a mAb that recognizes NS1 via a residue completely buried within the ED helix-helix interface, and which may help highlight potential different conformational populations of NS1 (putatively termed 'helix-closed' and 'helix-open') in virus-infected cells. 'Helix-closed' conformations appear to enhance dsRNA binding, and 'helix-open' conformations allow otherwise inaccessible interactions with host factors. Our data support a new model of NS1 regulation in which the RBD remains dimeric throughout infection, while the ED switches between several quaternary states in order to expand its functional space. Such a concept may be applicable to other small multifunctional proteins.},

abstract = {Non-structural protein 1 from influenza A virus, NS1A, is a key multifunctional virulence factor composed of two domains: an N-terminal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding domain and a C-terminal effector domain (ED). Isolated RNA-binding and effector domains of NS1A both exist as homodimers in solution. Despite recent crystal structures of isolated ED and full-length NS1A proteins from different influenza virus strains, controversy remains over the actual biologically relevant ED dimer interface. Here, we report the biophysical properties of the NS1A ED from H3N2 influenza A/Udorn/307/1972 (Ud) virus in solution. Several lines of evidence, including (15)N NMR relaxation, NMR chemical shift perturbations, static light scattering, and analytical sedimentation equilibrium, demonstrate that Ud NS1A ED forms a relatively weak dimer in solution (K(d) = 90 Â± 2 $\mu$m), featuring a symmetric helix-helix dimer interface. Mutations within and near this interface completely abolish dimerization, whereas mutations consistent with other proposed ED dimer interfaces have no effect on dimer formation. In addition, the critical Trp-187 residue in this interface serves as a sensitive NMR spectroscopic marker for the concentration-dependent dimerization of NS1A ED in solution. Finally, dynamic light scattering and gel shift binding experiments demonstrate that the ED interface plays a role in both the oligomerization and the dsRNA binding properties of the full-length NS1A protein. In particular, mutation of the critical tryptophan in the ED interface substantially reduces the propensity of full-length NS1A from different strains to oligomerize and results in a reduction in dsRNA binding affinity for full-length NS1A.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus (H1N1), a genetic reassortment of endemic strains of human, avian and swine flu, has crossed species barrier to human and apparently acquired the capability of human to human transmission. Some strains of H5N1 subtype are highly virulent because NS1 protein inhibits antiviral interferon $\alpha$/$\beta$ production. Another protein NS2 mediates export of viral ribonucleoprotein from nucleus to the cytoplasm through export signal. In this paper, we have studied structure-function relationships of these proteins of H1N1 subtype and have determined the cause of their pathogenicity. Our results showed that non-conservative mutations slightly stabilized or destabilized structural domains of NS1 or NS1-dsRNA complex, hence slightly increased or decreased the function of NS1 protein and consequently enhanced or reduced the pathogenicity of the H1N1 virus. NS2 protein of different strains carried non-conservative mutations in different domains, resulting in slight loss of function. These mutations slightly decreased the pathogenicity of the virus. Thus, the results confirm the structure-function relationships of these viral proteins.},

Here, I review the structural basis for some of these functions and discuss the emerging view that NS1 cannot simply be regarded as a 'static' protein with a single structure. Rather, the dynamic property of NS1 to adopt various quaternary conformations is critical for its multiple activities. Understanding NS1 plasticity, and the mechanisms governing this plasticity, will be essential for assessing both fundamental protein function and the consequences of strain-dependent polymorphisms in this important virulence factor.},

abstract = {Influenza A viruses cause a highly contagious respiratory disease in humans and are responsible for periodic widespread epidemics with high mortality rates. The influenza A virus NS1 protein (NS1A) plays a key role in countering host antiviral defense and in virulence. The 73-residue N-terminal domain of NS1A (NS1A-(1-73)) forms a symmetric homodimer with a unique six-helical chain fold. It binds canonical A-form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Mutational inactivation of this dsRNA binding activity of NS1A highly attenuates virus replication. Here, we have characterized the unique structural features of the dsRNA binding surface of NS1A-(1-73) using NMR methods and describe the 2.1-A x-ray crystal structure of the corresponding dsRNA binding domain from human influenza B virus NS1B-(15-93). These results identify conserved dsRNA binding surfaces on both NS1A-(1-73) and NS1B-(15-93) that are very different from those indicated in earlier "working models" of the complex between dsRNA and NS1A-(1-73). The combined NMR and crystallographic data reveal highly conserved surface tracks of basic and hydrophilic residues that interact with dsRNA. These tracks are structurally complementary to the polyphosphate backbone conformation of A-form dsRNA and run at an approximately 45 degrees angle relative to the axes of helices alpha2/alpha2'. At the center of this dsRNA binding epitope, and common to NS1 proteins from influenza A and B viruses, is a deep pocket that includes both hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. This pocket provides a target on the surface of the NS1 protein that is potentially suitable for the development of antiviral drugs targeting both influenza A and B viruses.},

abstract = {A short model genome RNA and also the genome RNA of influenza A virus bearing both 5'- and 3'-terminal common sequences activated the interferon-induced double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, by stimulating autophosphorylation in vitro. The activated PKR catalyzed phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eucaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). The NS1 protein efficiently eliminated the PKR-activating activity of these RNAs by binding to them. Two mutant NS1 proteins, each harboring a single amino acid substitution at different regions, exhibited temperature sensitivity in their RNA binding activity in the mutant virus-infected cell lysates as well as when they were prepared as fusion proteins expressed in bacteria. The virus strains carrying these mutant NS1 proteins exhibited temperature sensitivity in virus protein synthesis at the translational level, as reported previously, and could not repress the autophosphorylation of PKR developing during the virus growth, which is normally suppressed by a viral function(s). As a result, the level of eIF2alpha phosphorylation was elevated 2.5- to 3-fold. The defect in virus protein synthesis was well correlated with the level of phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2alpha.},

abstract = {NS1 of influenza A virus is a potent antagonist of host antiviral interferon responses. This multifunctional protein with two distinctive domains, an RNA-binding domain (RBD) and an effector domain (ED) separated by a linker region (LR), is implicated in replication, pathogenesis, and host range. Although the structures of individual domains of NS1 from different strains of influenza viruses have been reported, the only structure of full-length NS1 available to date is from an H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004). By carrying out crystallographic analyses of full-length H6N6-NS1 (A/blue-winged teal/MN/993/1980) and an LR deletion mutant, combined with mutational analysis, we show here that these full-length NS1 structures provide an exquisite structural sampling of various conformational states of NS1 that based on the orientation of the ED with respect to RBD can be summarized as "open," "semi-open," and "closed" conformations. Our studies show that preference for these states is clearly dictated by determinants such as linker length, residue composition at position 71, and a mechanical hinge, providing a structural basis for strain-dependent functional variations in NS1. Because of the flexibility inherent in the LR, any particular NS1 could sample the conformational space around these states to engage ED in different quaternary interactions so that it may participate in specific protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions to allow for the known multifunctionality of NS1. We propose that such conformational plasticity provides a mechanism for autoregulating NS1 functions, depending on its temporal distribution, posttranslational modifications, and nuclear or cellular localization, during the course of virus infection. IMPORTANCE: NS1 of influenza A virus is a multifunctional protein associated with numerous strain-specific regulatory functions during viral infection, including conferring resistance to antiviral interferon induction, replication, pathogenesis, virulence, and host range. NS1 has two domains, an RNA-binding domain and an effector domain separated by a linker. To date, the only full-length NS1 structure available is that from an H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004). Here, we determined crystal structures of the wild type and a linker region mutant of the H6N6 NS1 (A/blue-winged teal/MN/993/1980), which together with the previously determined H5N1 NS1 structure show that NS1 exhibits significant strain-dependent structural polymorphism due to variations in linker length, residue composition at position 71, and a mechanical hinge. Such a structural polymorphism may be the basis for strain-specific functions associated with NS1.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus NS1 protein is a multifunctional virulence factor. Here, we report a crystal structure for the NS1 effector domain of avian influenza virus A/Duck/Albany/76. Comparison of this structure with that reported for a human strain shows both proteins share a common monomer conformation, albeit with subtle differences. Strikingly, our data reveal a novel helix-helix dimeric interface between monomers of the avian NS1 protein, which is also found in the human NS1 crystal lattice. We re-evaluate the current model of NS1 dimeric assembly, and provide biochemical evidence to show tryptophan-187 (a residue located at the helix-helix interface) is essential for dimerization of this effector domain.},

abstract = {The influenza virus nonstructural protein 1 encoded by influenza A virus (NS1A protein) is a multifunctional protein involved in both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. NS1A binds nonspecifically to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and to specific protein targets, and regulates several post-transcriptional processes. The N-terminal structural domain corresponding to the first 73 amino acids of the NS1 protein from influenza A/Udorn/72 virus [NS1A(1-73)] possesses all of the dsRNA binding activities of the full-length protein. Both NMR and X-ray crystallography of this domain have demonstrated that it is a symmetric homodimer which forms a six-helix chain fold, a unique structure that differs from that of the predominant class of dsRNA-binding domains, termed dsRBDs, that are found in a large number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins. Here we describe biophysical experiments on complexes containing NS1A(1-73) and a short 16 bp synthetic dsRNA duplex. From sedimentation equilibrium measurements, we determined that the dimeric NS1A(1-73) binds to the dsRNA duplex with a 1:1 stoichiometry, yielding a complex with an apparent dissociation constant (K(d)) of approximately 1 microM. Circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data demonstrate that the conformations of both NS1A(1-73) and dsRNA in the complex are similar to their free forms, indicating little or no structural change in the protein or RNA upon complex formation. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments show that the dsRNA-binding epitope of NS1A(1-73) is associated with helices 2 and 2'. Analytical gel filtration and gel shift studies of the interaction between NS1A(1-73) and different double-stranded nucleic acids indicate that NS1A(1-73) recognizes canonical A-form dsRNA, but does not bind to dsDNA or dsRNA-DNA hybrids, which feature B-type or A/B-type intermediate conformations, respectively. On the basis of these results, we propose a three-dimensional model of the complex in which NS1A(1-73) sits astride the minor groove of A-form RNA with a few amino acids in the helix 2-helix 2' face forming an electrostatically stabilized interaction with the phosphodiester backbone. This mode of dsRNA binding differs from that observed for any other dsRNA-binding protein.},

abstract = {Influenza A viruses are important human pathogens causing periodic pandemic threats. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) protein of influenza A virus (NS1A) shields the virus against host defense. Here, we report the crystal structure of NS1A RNA-binding domain (RBD) bound to a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) at 1.7A. NS1A RBD forms a homodimer to recognize the major groove of A-form dsRNA in a length-independent mode by its conserved concave surface formed by dimeric anti-parallel alpha-helices. dsRNA is anchored by a pair of invariable arginines (Arg38) from both monomers by extensive hydrogen bonds. In accordance with the structural observation, isothermal titration calorimetry assay shows that the unique Arg38-Arg38 pair and two Arg35-Arg46 pairs are crucial for dsRNA binding, and that Ser42 and Thr49 are also important for dsRNA binding. Agrobacterium co-infiltration assay further supports that the unique Arg38 pair plays important roles in dsRNA binding in vivo.Cell Research (2009) 19:187-195. doi: 10.1038/cr.2008.288; published online 23 September 2008.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of highly pathogenic avian (H5N1) influenza viruses, their epizootic and panzootic nature, and their association with lethal human infections have raised significant global health concerns. Several studies have underlined the importance of non-structural protein NS1 in the increased pathogenicity and virulence of these strains. NS1, which consists of two domains-a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain and the effector domain, separated through a linker-is an antagonist of antiviral type-I interferon response in the host. Here we report the X-ray structure of the full-length NS1 from an H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) that was associated with 60\% of human deaths in an outbreak in Vietnam. Compared to the individually determined structures of the RNA binding domain and the effector domain from non-H5N1 strains, the RNA binding domain within H5N1 NS1 exhibits modest structural changes, while the H5N1 effector domain shows significant alteration, particularly in the dimeric interface. Although both domains in the full-length NS1 individually participate in dimeric interactions, an unexpected finding is that these interactions result in the formation of a chain of NS1 molecules instead of distinct dimeric units. Three such chains in the crystal interact with one another extensively to form a tubular organization of similar dimensions to that observed in the cryo-electron microscopy images of NS1 in the presence of dsRNA. The tubular oligomeric organization of NS1, in which residues implicated in dsRNA binding face a 20-A-wide central tunnel, provides a plausible mechanism for how NS1 sequesters varying lengths of dsRNA, to counter cellular antiviral dsRNA response pathways, while simultaneously interacting with other cellular ligands during an infection.},

Here, the crystallographic structure of the NS1A effector domain of influenza A/Udorn/72 virus is presented. Structure comparison with the NS1 effector domain from mouse-adapted influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus strain reveals a similar monomer conformation but a different dimer interface. Further analysis and evaluation shows that the dimer interface observed in the structure of the PR8 NS1 effector domain is likely to be a crystallographic packing effect.

abstract = {The influenza A virus nonstructural protein NS1 is a multifunctional dimeric protein that acts as a potent inhibitor of the host cellular antiviral state. The C-terminal effector domain of NS1 binds host proteins, including CPSF30, and is a target for the development of new antiviral drugs. Here we present crystallographic structures of two mutant effector domains, W187Y and W187A, of influenza A/Udorn/72 virus. Unlike wild-type, the mutants behave exclusively as monomers in solution based on gel filtration data and light scattering. The W187Y mutant is able to bind CPSF30 with a binding affinity close to the wild-type protein; that is, it retains a receptor site for aromatic ligands nearly identical to the wild-type. Therefore, this monomeric mutant protein could serve as a drug target for a high throughput inhibitor screening assays, since its binding pocket is unoccupied in solution and potentially more accessible to small molecule ligands.},
