abstract = {Oligonucleotide analysis of two avian influenza A viruses (Hav6N2 and Hav6Nav4) isolated in nature showed identical or almost identical patterns for the corresponding M and HA genes; 24 of 25 and 13 of 13 large oligonucleotides were indistinguishable by two-dimensional gel analysis. On the other hand, remarkable differences in the oligonucleotide patterns of the remaining genes were observed. Only 2 of 11 oligonucleotide spots of the NS gene, 10 of 27 spots of the NA/NP genes, and 22 of 49 spots of the P genes were indistinguishable between the two strains. On the basis of this observation that at least two genes of these viruses are virtually identical whereas others show easily detectable differences, we conclude that the two avian strains are related to each other by a recombinational event. In addition, it was found that animals in nature can be doubly infected with influenza viruses. Both lines of evidence strongly suggest that recombination is at least one mechanism by which "new" influenza virus strains emerge in nature.},

@article{Drake1993,
abstract = {Simple methods are presented to estimate rates of spontaneous mutation from mutant frequencies and population parameters in RNA viruses. Published mutant frequencies yield a wide range of mutation rates per genome per replication, mainly because mutational targets have usually been small and, thus, poor samples of the mutability of the average base. Nevertheless, there is a clear central tendency for lytic RNA viruses (bacteriophage Q beta, poliomyelitis, vesicular stomatitis, and influenza A) to display rates of spontaneous mutation of approximately 1 per genome per replication. This rate is some 300-fold higher than previously reported for DNA-based microbes. Lytic RNA viruses thus mutate at a rate close to the maximum value compatible with viability. Retroviruses (spleen necrosis, murine leukemia, Rous sarcoma), however, mutate at an average rate about an order of magnitude lower than lytic RNA viruses.},

@article{Parvin1986,
abstract = {Epidemiologic and genetic evidence suggests that influenza A viruses evolve more rapidly than other viruses in humans. Although the high mutation rate of the virus is often cited as the cause of the extensive variation, direct measurement of this parameter has not been obtained in vivo. In this study, the rate of mutation in tissue culture for the nonstructural (NS) gene of influenza A virus and for the VP1 gene in poliovirus type 1 was assayed by direct sequence analysis. Each gene was repeatedly sequenced in over 100 viral clones which were descended from a single virion in one plaque generation. A total of 108 NS genes of influenza virus were sequenced, and in the 91,708 nucleotides analyzed, seven point changes were observed. A total of 105 VP1 genes of poliovirus were sequenced, and in the 95,688 nucleotides analyzed, no mutations were observed. We then calculated mutation rates of 1.5 X 10(-5) and less than 2.1 X 10(-6) mutations per nucleotide per infectious cycle for influenza virus and poliovirus, respectively. We suggest that the higher mutation rate of influenza A virus may promote the rapid evolution of this virus in nature.},

abstract = {The genomic RNA of the avian influenza A virus, fowl plague, was fractionated into eight species by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide-agarose gels containing 6 M urea. The separated 32P-labeled RNA species were characterized by digestion with RNase T1 and fractionation of the resulting oligonucleotides by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; this demonstrated that each species has a distinct nucleotide sequence. A tentative correlation of each genome RNA species with the virus protein that it encodes was made.},

@article{Steinhauer2002,
abstract = {Influenza A viruses contain genomes composed of eight separate segments of negative-sense RNA. Circulating human strains are notorious for their tendency to accumulate mutations from one year to the next and cause recurrent epidemics. However, the segmented nature of the genome also allows for the exchange of entire genes between different viral strains. The ability to manipulate influenza gene segments in various combinations in the laboratory has contributed to its being one of the best characterized viruses, and studies on influenza have provided key contributions toward the understanding of various aspects of virology in general. However, the genetic plasticity of influenza viruses also has serious potential implications regarding vaccine design, pathogenicity, and the capacity for novel viruses to emerge from natural reservoirs and cause global pandemics.},
