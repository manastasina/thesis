abstract = {The influenza pandemic that emerged in 2009 provided an unprecedented opportunity to study adaptation of a virus recently acquired from an animal source during human transmission. In the United Kingdom, the novel virus spread in three temporally distinct waves between 2009 and 2011. Phylogenetic analysis of complete viral genomes showed that mutations accumulated over time. Second- and third-wave viruses replicated more rapidly in human airway epithelial (HAE) cells than did the first-wave virus. In infected mice, weight loss varied between viral isolates from the same wave but showed no distinct pattern with wave and did not correlate with viral load in the mouse lungs or severity of disease in the human donor. However, second- and third-wave viruses induced less alpha interferon in the infected mouse lungs. NS1 protein, an interferon antagonist, had accumulated several mutations in second- and third-wave viruses. Recombinant viruses with the third-wave NS gene induced less interferon in human cells, but this alone did not account for increased virus fitness in HAE cells. Mutations in HA and NA genes in third-wave viruses caused increased binding to alpha-2,6-sialic acid and enhanced infectivity in human mucus. A recombinant virus with these two segments replicated more efficiently in HAE cells. A mutation in PA (N321K) enhanced polymerase activity of third-wave viruses and also provided a replicative advantage in HAE cells. Therefore, multiple mutations allowed incremental changes in viral fitness, which together may have contributed to the apparent increase in severity of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus during successive waves. IMPORTANCE: Although most people infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza virus had mild or unapparent symptoms, some suffered severe and devastating disease. The reasons for this variability were unknown, but the numbers of severe cases increased during successive waves of human infection in the United Kingdom. To determine the causes of this variation, we studied genetic changes in virus isolates from individual hospitalized patients. There were no consistent differences between these viruses and those circulating in the community, but we found multiple evolutionary changes that in combination over time increased the virus's ability to infect human cells. These adaptations may explain the remarkable ability of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus to continue to circulate despite widespread immunity and the apparent increase in severity of influenza over successive waves of infection.},

abstract = {More and more H5N1 subtype avian influenza viruses possessing a 15-nucleotide (15-nt) deletion in the viral nonstructural protein (NS) gene from position 263 to 277 have emerged since 2000. In order to investigate the biological significance of this deletion, two pairs of H5N1 reassortants designated as rWSN-SD versus rWSN-mSD and rWSN-YZ versus rWSN-mYZ were generated by reverse genetics technique. These recombinant viruses shared the same inner genes of PB1, PB2, PA, NP, and M from strain A/WSN/33(H1N1) and outer genes of HA and NA from strain A/Duck/Shandong/093/2004 (H5N1) (A/D/SD/04), whereas they bore different NS gene. Recombinant rWSN-SD carried the full sequence NS gene from A/D/SD/04 in the natural state without deletion, whereas rWSN-mSD carried the same NS gene, but with an artificial 15-nt deletion from position 263 to 277. On the other hand, rWSN-YZ contained the NS gene in the natural state with a deletion from A/Duck/Yangzhou/232/2004 (H5N1) (A/D/YZ/04), while rWSN-mYZ bore the same NS gene but with an artificial insertion of 15-nt in site 263-277. All the four reassortants grew well in embryonated chicken eggs with similar mean death time (MDT) and viral titer of EID50 or HA. However, the virulence of these reassortant viruses in chickens and mice was different. Reassortant viruses with deletion in their NS gene (rWSN-mSD and rWSN-YZ) had much higher intraveneous pathogenicity index (IVPI) in chickens and lower MLD50 in mice than their counterparts without the deletion (rWSN-SD and rWSN-mYZ). Furthermore, rWSN-mSD and rWSN-YZ caused significantly more deaths in infected chickens and higher virus titers in tissues of inoculated mice than did rWSN-SD and rWSN-mYZ respectively. Sequence analysis also showed that H5N1 viruses carrying the 15-nt deletion in the NS gene invariably had the D92E shift in their NS1 protein. The results indicated that the 15-nucleotide deletion of NS gene from site 263 to 277 associated with D92E shift in NS1 protein contributes to the virulence increase of H5N1 viruses in chickens and mice.},

@article{Parvin1983,
abstract = {The proteins from cells infected with influenza A virus field isolates were labeled with [35S]methionine and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. By screening more than 100 field isolates, it was found that the NS1 proteins had the greatest mobility differences, far exceeding those observed among other corresponding viral polypeptides. Partial sequence determination of RNA segment eight from 12 viruses revealed the existence of nonsense mutations at six different positions in their NS1 coding regions. The termination codons consisted of opal, ochre, and amber mutations. The sizes predicted from these sequences of 202, 217, 219, 220, 230, and 237 amino acids were in agreement with the observed mobilities of the viral polypeptides on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The observation of large deletions in the carboxy termini of the NS1 proteins of field virus isolates would suggest that a high degree of variation can be tolerated in this polypeptide without affecting its functional capability.},

@article{Suarez1998,
abstract = {One hundred and six influenza A virus isolates were compared phylogenetically using gene segment 8 which encodes the two non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1 and NS2. The isolates separated into two previously described subtypes, A and B. For non-structural gene subtype A viruses, five subdivisions were distinguished in the nucleotide phylogenetic tree including a human-swine group, American avian-equine group, Eurasian avian-swine group, a unique gull isolate group, and a group with a single member, A/Equine/Prague/56. At the nucleotide sequence level the B subtype was subdivided into two groups, including the American avian group and Eurasian avian-equine group. In the analysis of the NS1 and NS2 predicted amino acid sequence, American and Eurasian influenza isolates became less distinguishable. Size variability of the NS1 protein was observed, especially in the human and swine isolates. The previously reported deletion in A/Turkey/Oregon/71 NS1 gene, which caused a truncated NS1 protein, was contrasted with a full length NS1 gene cloned from an earlier A/Turkey/Oregon/71 stock. All avian origin influenza viruses had a putative NS1 sequence length of 230 aa, with two exceptions, A/CK/Pennsylvania/1370/83 and A/CK/Pennsylvania/21525/83, with an NS1 protein of 217 aa.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza pandemic remains a serious threat to human health. Viruses of avian origin, H5N1, H7N7 and H9N2, have repeatedly crossed the species barrier to infect humans. Recently, a novel strain originated from swine has evolved to a pandemic. This study aims at improving our understanding on the pathogenic mechanism of influenza viruses, in particular the role of non-structural (NS1) protein in inducing pro-inflammatory and apoptotic responses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Human lung epithelial cells (NCI-H292) was used as an in-vitro model to study cytokine/chemokine production and apoptosis induced by transfection of NS1 mRNA encoded by seven infleunza subtypes (seasonal and pandemic H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, and H9), respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The results showed that CXCL-10/IP10 was most prominently induced (> 1000 folds) and IL-6 was slightly induced (< 10 folds) by all subtypes. A subtype-dependent pattern was observed for CCL-2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1$\alpha$, CCL-5/RANTES and CXCL-9/MIG; where induction by H5N1 was much higher than all other subtypes examined. All subtypes induced a similar temporal profile of apoptosis following transfection. The level of apoptosis induced by H5N1 was remarkably higher than all others. The cytokine/chemokine and apoptosis inducing ability of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 was similar to previous seasonal strains.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the NS1 protein encoded by H5N1 carries a remarkably different property as compared to other avian and human subtypes, and is one of the keys to its high pathogenicity. NCI-H292 cells system proves to be a good in-vitro model to delineate the property of NS1 proteins.},

@article{Ludwig1991,
abstract = {Phylogenetic trees were constructed using 38 sequences of the A group and 10 sequences of the B group of the NS gene of influenza A viruses. Within the A group we found avian as well as mammalian influenza a viruses, while within the B group exclusively avian strains were found. The avian and human NS genes of the A group were derived from a common ancestor existing at about 1912. At 13 positions of the amino acid sequences of the NS1 protein two subtypes of the A group can be differentiated, a human and a non-human subtype. Starting at the time of the introduction of an avian PB1 gene into human strains during the antigenic shift at 1957 the NS1 protein of the human strains came under an enhanced selection pressure which might indicate a cooperation of the NS1 protein with and adaptation of the NS1 protein on the newly introduced PB1 gene. Such a selection pressure on the NS2 protein is completely missing. Comparison of all sequences of the NS1 protein revealed four highly conserved regions within the amino-terminal half of the molecule. One of this regions seems to contain the nuclear migration signal. The carboxy-terminal half is completely variable and seems to be dispensable.},

@article{Treanor1989,
abstract = {The nonstructural (NS) genes of avian influenza A viruses have been divided into  two groups on the basis of nucleotide sequence homology, which we have referred to here as alleles A and B. We sequenced the NS genes of eight additional avian influenza A viruses in order to define the differences between these two alleles more thoroughly. Four of the viruses had NS gene sequences which resembled that of A/FPV/Rostock/34 and belonged to allele A while the other four viruses had NS gene sequences more similar to that of A/Duck/Alberta/76 and belonged to allele B. There was approximately 90\% sequence homology within alleles and 72\% homology between alleles. As previously reported the NS genes of human influenza A viruses belong to allele A. We constructed single gene avian-human reassortant influenza A viruses containing an allele A or B NS gene segment from an avian influenza A virus and all other genes from a human influenza A virus and tested these reassortants for their ability to grow in the respiratory tract of a nonhuman primate. Reassortants containing an avian NS gene segment of allele B were significantly restricted in growth in the respiratory tract of squirrel monkeys while reassortants with an allele A NS gene segment were not. The divergent evolution of the B NS allele in birds may have resulted in gene products which do not function optimally in cooperation with genes from a human virus in viral replication in primate respiratory epithelium.},

@article{Tu2011a,
abstract = {The 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus encodes an NS1 protein with 11 amino acids (aa) truncation at the C-terminus. The C-terminal tail of influenza virus NS1 protein constitutes a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) and is the binding domain of the cellular pre-mRNA processing protein, poly(A)-binding protein II (PABII). Here, our studies showed that the C-terminal-truncated NS1 of the 2009 pandemic virus was inefficient at blocking host gene expression, extension of the truncated NS1 to its full length increased the inhibition of host gene expression. Mechanistically, this increased inhibition of host gene expression by the full-length NS1 was not associated with nucleolar localization, but was due to the restoration of NS1's binding capacity to PABII. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo characterization of two recombinant viruses encoding either the C-terminal 11-aa truncated or full-length NS1 of the 2009 pandemic virus showed that the C-terminal 11-aa truncation in NS1 did not significantly alter virus replication, but increased virus pathogenicity in mice.},

abstract = {The 'classical' swine H1N1 influenza A virus lineage was established after the devastating 1918 human pandemic virus entered domestic pig herds. A descendent of this lineage recently re-emerged in humans as the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Adaptation in pigs has led to several changes in the multifunctional viral NS1 protein as compared with the parental 1918 virus, most notably a K217E substitution that abolishes binding to host Crk/CrkL signalling adapters, and an 11 aa C-terminal truncation. Using reverse genetics, we reintroduced both these features into a prototype 2009 H1N1 strain, A/California/04/09. Restoration of Crk/CrkL binding or extension of NS1 to 230 aa had no impact on virus replication in human or swine cells. In addition, minimal effects on replication, pathogenicity and transmission were observed in mouse and ferret models. Our data suggest that the currently circulating 2009 H1N1 virus is optimized to replicate efficiently without requiring certain NS1 functions.},
