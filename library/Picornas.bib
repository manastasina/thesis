abstract = {Many picornaviruses use cell-surface molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) as their cellular receptors. These molecules usually consist of tandem repeats of between two and five Ig-like domains whose amino-terminal domains (D1) interact with invading viruses, with their carboxy-terminal sections comprising a transmembrane and a short cytoplasmic region. Most rhino- and enteroviruses, belonging to the Picornavirus family, use a canyon-like feature on their surface to attach to cellular receptors. Binding into the canyon destabilizes the virus and thus initiates the uncoating process. By contrast, non-IgSF molecules, when used by picornaviruses as receptors, bind outside the canyon and do not cause viral instability.},

abstract = {All single-stranded 'positive-sense' RNA viruses that infect mammalian, insect or plant cells rearrange internal cellular membranes to provide an environment facilitating virus replication. A striking feature of these unique membrane structures is the induction of 70-100 nm vesicles (either free within the cytoplasm, associated with other induced vesicles or bound within a surrounding membrane) harbouring the viral replication complex (RC). Although similar in appearance, the cellular composition of these vesicles appears to vary for different viruses, implying different organelle origins for the intracellular sites of viral RNA replication. Genetic analysis has revealed that induction of these membrane structures can be attributed to a particular viral gene product, usually a non-structural protein. This review will highlight our current knowledge of the formation and composition of virus RCs and describe some of the similarities and differences in RNA-membrane interactions observed between the virus families Flaviviridae and Picornaviridae.},

abstract = {For a virus to invade a host cell it needs to penetrate the physical barrier imposed by the plasma membrane. Viruses have evolved specialized surface proteins to meet this challenge. These proteins facilitate delivery of the viral genetic information into the host cell by either fusing the viral envelope with a host cell membrane (enveloped viruses) or by forming membrane pores (non-enveloped viruses). Membrane fusion and pore formation critically depend on the engagement of host cell receptors and receptor choice is a key determinant of viral tropism. The multi-faceted interplay between viral and cellular factors during virus entry is a fascinating field of study, which can provide important insight into viral pathogenesis and define new targets for intervention. This book provides a comprehensive overview of this exciting field of research. The first step in viral entry is the attachment of virions to target cells. Cellular factors which promote viral attachment and their role in virus infection are reviewed by Jolly and Sattentau. Two chapters review key processes underlying host cell entry of non-enveloped viruses: Bergelson and Coyne discuss the cell biology of picornavirus entry. These viruses exploit various endocytic pathways to invade cells and, by binding to cell surface receptors, activate signaling cascades which prime the cells for infection. Cellular entry of reoviruses is discussed by Danthi and colleagues. Members of the reovirus family depend on the cellular proteases cathepsins B and L for disassembly and viral structures exposed during disassembly can induce signaling cascades, which drive cells into apoptosis. Enveloped viruses have evolved three related yet distinct solutions to bind and enter target cells: Class I, II and III membrane fusion proteins. Class I membrane fusion proteins are discussed in four chapters. Sun and Whittaker introduce the prototype class I membrane fusion protein, the influenza virus hemagglutinin. Simmons discusses entry of Ebola and Marburg virus, the only members of the filoviridae family. These viruses enter an extremely broad range of cells in a pH-dependent fashion. However, the pH-dependence is indirect: An acidic milieu is required for the activity of cathepsins B and L, which prime the viral glycoprotein for membrane fusion. A particular solution to host cell entry has been evolved by paramyxoviruses, which encode two distinct proteins to accomplish attachment to host cells and membrane fusion. Bossart and Broder describe how these proteins cooperate during host cell entry. Retroviruses comprise important human pathogens and are frequently used to study virus-host interactions during entry. Lindemann and colleagues review how foamy virus and HIV select and enter target cells. Class II membrane fusion proteins are structure- and sequence-wise different from class I fusion proteins but employ related mechanisms to merge the viral and cellular membranes. The key features of class II membrane fusion proteins are discussed by Modis. Class III membrane fusion proteins combine elements of the other classes and are only found in herpes-, rhabdo- and baculoviruses. Regan and Whittaker guide the reader through each step of host cell entry of rhabdoviruses. Entry of herpes viruses into host cells is facilitated by several viral glycoproteins and is regulated by glycoprotein-glycoprotein and glycoprotein-receptor interactions. The respective processes are reviewed by Krummenacher and colleagues, with a particular focus on the structures involved in receptor binding.},

@article{Steil2009,
abstract = {Our understanding of picornavirus RNA replication has improved over the past 10 years, due in large part to the discovery of cis-active RNA elements (CREs) within picornavirus RNA genomes. CREs function as templates for the conversion of VPg, the Viral Protein of the genome, into VPgpUpUOH. These so called CREs are different from the previously recognized cis-active RNA sequences and structures within the 5??? and 3??? NTRs of picornavirus genomes. Two adenosine residues in the loop of the CRE RNA structures allow the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3DPol to add two uridine residues to the tyrosine residue of VPg. Because VPg and/or VPgpUpUOH prime the initiation of viral RNA replication, the asymmetric replication of viral RNA could not be explained without an understanding of the viral RNA template involved in the conversion of VPg into VPgpUpUOH primers. We review the growing body of knowledge regarding picornavirus CREs and discuss how CRE RNAs work coordinately with viral replication proteins and other cis-active RNAs in the 5??? and 3??? NTRs during RNA replication. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
