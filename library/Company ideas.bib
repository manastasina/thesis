abstract = {Members of the Picornaviridae family are non-enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a 30. nm icosahedral capsid. This virus family exhibits a considerable amount of genetic variability driven both by mutation and recombination. Recently, three previously unknown human picornaviruses, namely the human Saffold cardiovirus, cosavirus and salivirus, have been identified in stools or respiratory samples from subjects presenting symptoms ranging from gastroenteritis to acute flaccid paralysis. However, these viruses were also frequently detected in asymptomatic subjects and their clinical relevance remains to be elucidated. The Enterovirus genus is a prototype example of the Picornaviridae heterogeneity at both genetic and phenotypic levels. This genus is divided into 10 species, seven of which contain human viruses, including three Rhinovirus species. Both human rhino- and enteroviruses are also characterized by high levels of genetic variability, as exemplified by the existence of over 250 different serotypes and the recent discovery of new enterovirus genotypes and the Rhinovirus C species. Despite their common genomic features, rhinoviruses are restricted to the respiratory tract, whereas the vast majority of enteroviruses infect the gastrointestinal tract and can spread to other organs, such as the heart or the central nervous system. Understanding the genetic determinants of such phenotypic diversity is an important challenge and a field for future investigation. Better characterization of these ubiquitous human pathogens may help to develop vaccines or antiviral treatments and to monitor the emergence of new strains. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Viral myocarditis is an important cause of heart failure for which no specific treatments are available. Direct viral injury to cardiac cells provokes an inflammatory response that significantly contributes to cardiac damage and ensuing morbidity. Despite the central pathogenic role of autoimmune injury, broad inhibition of the inflammatory response does not result in patient benefit. Many preclinical studies collectively emphasize that modulating distinct inflammatory signaling pathways may yield effective viral clearance while preserving cardiac structure.

It is one of the important causes of dilated cardiomyopathy worldwide. The diagnosis is presumed on clinical presentation and noninvasive diagnostic methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard for in vivo diagnosis of myocarditis. The therapeutic and prognostic benefits of endomyocardial biopsy results have recently been demonstrated in several clinical trials. Although remarkable advances in diagnosis, understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment of acute myocarditis were gained during the last years, no standard treatment strategies could be defined as yet, apart from standard heart failure therapy and physical rest. In severe cases, mechanical support or heart transplantation may become necessary. There is some evidence that immunosuppressive and immunomodulating therapy are effective for chronic, virus-negative inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Further investigations by controlled, randomized studies are needed to definitively determine their role in the treatment of myocarditis. ?? 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Improved ways to diagnose acute respiratory viral infections could decrease inappropriate antibacterial use and serve as a vital triage mechanism in the event of a potential viral pandemic. Measurement of the host response to infection is an alternative to pathogen-based diagnostic testing and may improve diagnostic accuracy. We have developed a host-based assay with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) platform for classifying respiratory viral infection. We developed the assay using two cohorts experimentally infected with influenza A H3N2/Wisconsin or influenza A H1N1/Brisbane, and validated the assay in a sample of adults presenting to the emergency department with fever (n = 102) and in healthy volunteers (n = 41). Peripheral blood RNA samples were obtained from individuals who underwent experimental viral challenge or who presented to the emergency department and had microbiologically proven viral respiratory infection or systemic bacterial infection. The selected gene set on the RT-PCR TLDA assay classified participants with experimentally induced influenza H3N2 and H1N1 infection with 100 and 87\% accuracy, respectively. We validated this host gene expression signature in a cohort of 102 individuals arriving at the emergency department. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR test was 89\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 72 to 98\%], and the specificity was 94\% (95\% CI, 86 to 99\%). These results show that RT-PCR-based detection of a host gene expression signature can classify individuals with respiratory viral infection and sets the stage for prospective evaluation of this diagnostic approach in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Timely knowledge of the bacterial etiology and localization of infection are important for empirical antibiotic therapy. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate routinely used biomarkers together with novel laboratory parameters in the diagnosis of infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In this prospective study, 54 adult patients with bacterial infections admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases were included. For comparison, 27 patients with viral infections were enrolled. In these patients, white blood cell (WBC) counts, differential blood counts, serum levels of procalcitonin (PCT), IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$, soluble CD14 (sCD14), heparin-binding protein (HBP), cortisol (Cort), and monocyte surface expression of TLR2, TLR4, HLA-DR, and CD14 were analyzed. Also, these biomarkers were evaluated in 21 patients with acute community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), as well as in 21 patients with pyelonephritis and urosepsis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The highest sensitivity and specificity (expressed as the area under the curve [AUC]) for bacterial infection were observed in serum concentration of PCT (0.952), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts (0.852 and 0.841, respectively), and serum levels of HBP (0.837), IL-6 (0.830), and Cort (0.817). In addition, the serum levels of IFN-$\gamma$ and Cort were significantly higher and IL-8 levels were lower in CABP when compared to pyelonephritis or urosepsis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: From the novel potential biomarkers, only PCT demonstrated superiority over the routine parameters in the differentiation of bacterial from viral infections. However, some of the novel parameters should be further evaluated in larger and better characterized cohorts of patients in order to find their clinical applications.},

abstract = {Interferon alpha (IFN$\alpha$), a type I interferon, can be considered as a viral infection marker because this cytokine is induced during many viral infections. However, it is quite difficult to detect IFN$\alpha$ in sera. Investigations are interested in various intra-cellular IFN$\alpha$-induced proteins as viral infection markers. However the activity of these enzymes increased not only in response to type I IFNs but also to type II IFN. MxA protein can be detected in the cytoplasm of IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$-treated cells, whereas other cytokines, including IFN$\gamma$, are poor inducers. Using an immunochemiluminescent assay, we studied MxA protein in whole blood of 34 patients with various viral infections. The whole blood was drawn into sterile vacuum tubes containing heparin or EDTA. MxA values were relatively similar in heparin-treated samples and EDTA-treated samples, with differences not exceeding 1 ng/ml. The levels of MxA protein were compared in whole blood obtained by using two different lysis procedures. A correlation was found between the MxA levels obtained by using procedure I and procedure II, but higher amounts of MxA protein were found with procedure II. The second procedure is rapid and more convenient than the other and it is carried out in one step which reduce technical problems. High levels of MxA protein were found in peripheral blood cells of patients with acute viral infections (Rotavirus, Adenovirus, RSV, CMV), but MxA protein was not elevated in bacterial infections. The MxA levels were also studied in peripheral blood of 32 HCV positive patients. MxA protein was not found in most of IFN$\alpha$-untreated patients, even those with high viral load. In contrast, high levels of MxA protein were found in IFN$\alpha$-treated patients. MxA quantitation can be considered as a specific marker of acute viral infections, and could be useful in the management of treatment with IFN$\alpha$.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated whether myocyte injury can be assessed sensitively by measurement of serum levels of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis and whether cTnT levels may predict the results of histologic and immunohistologic analysis of endomyocardial biopsy specimens. BACKGROUND: Conventionally used laboratory variables often fail to show myocyte injury in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, possibly because of a low extent of myocardial injury in these patients. Sensitive variables for myocyte injury have not yet been investigated. METHODS: Eighty patients with clinically suspected myocarditis were screened for creatine kinase (CK) activity, MB isoform of CK (CK-MB) activity and cTnT. Endomyocardial biopsy specimens were examined histologically and immunohistologically. RESULTS: cTnT was elevated in 28 of 80 patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, CK in 4 and CK-MB in 1. Histologic analysis alone of the endomyocardial biopsy specimen revealed evidence of myocarditis in only five patients, all with elevated cTnT levels. Twenty-three of 28 patients with elevated cTnT levels had histologically negative findings for myocarditis. Additional immunohistologic analysis revealed evidence of myocarditis in 26 (93\%) of 28 patients with elevated cTnT levels and in 23 (44\%) of 52 patients with normal cTnT levels. Mean cTnT levels were higher in patients with myocarditis proved histologically or immunohistologically, or both, than in patients without myocarditis (0.59 +/- 1.68 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.05, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of serum levels of cTnT provides evidence of myocyte injury in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis more sensitively than does conventional determination of cardiac enzyme levels. Myocardial cell damage may be present even in the absence of histologic signs of myocarditis. Additional immunohistologic analysis often shows lymphocytic infiltrates in these patients. Elevated levels of cTnT are highly predictive for myocarditis in this group.},

abstract = {Heart failure (HF) may be considered as the fatal finishing line of all cardiovascular disorders. Despite advances in the understanding and treatment, it still has a poor prognosis. Heart failure is a syndrome, rather than a primary diagnosis, which results from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the heart to support the physiological circulation. This is sustained by a chronic imbalance in the neurohormonal control of circulation. Unfortunately, there is no single diagnostic test for HF, and the accuracy of diagnosis by clinical means only (i.e. a combination of history, physical examination and appropriate investigations) is often inadequate. Diagnosis and risk stratification depend on the availability of accurate, and effective markers of either risk or disease. There is an increasing interest in the development of new biomarkers, and a great number of laboratory tests have recently been proposed. The goals of this 'commentary' are to (i) briefly discuss the characteristics of an ideal HF biomarker; (ii) describe the analytical performance and clinical relevance of currently available biomarker assay methods, (iii) evaluate newer biomarkers and finally, (iv) design a scheme to optimize the search for efficient diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for HF.},
