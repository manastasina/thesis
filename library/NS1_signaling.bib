abstract = {Influenza A virus NS1 is a multifunctional protein, and in virus-infected cells NS1 modulates a number of host-cell processes by interacting with cellular factors. Here, we report that NS1 binds directly to p85beta, a regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), but not to the related p85alpha subunit. Activation of PI3K in influenza virus-infected cells depended on genome replication, and showed kinetics that correlated with NS1 expression. Additionally, it was found that expression of NS1 alone was sufficient to constitutively activate PI3K, causing the phosphorylation of a downstream mediator of PI3K signal transduction, Akt. Mutational analysis of a potential SH2-binding motif within NS1 indicated that the highly conserved tyrosine at residue 89 is important for both the interaction with p85beta, and the activation of PI3K. A mutant influenza virus (A/Udorn/72) expressing NS1 with the Y89F amino acid substitution exhibited a small-plaque phenotype, and grew more slowly in tissue culture than WT virus. These data suggest that activation of PI3K signaling in influenza A virus-infected cells is important for efficient virus replication.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus infection activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway by binding influenza A virus NS1 protein to the p85beta regulatory subunit of PI3K. In this study, we report that NS1 binds to the inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain of p85beta. Mutational analyses on p85beta iSH2 domain defined that Val-573 is the critical amino acid (AA) that mediates NS1 and p85beta interaction. In reciprocal gain of function experiments with p85alpha, we demonstrated that mutation to Val at Met-582 leads to NS1 binding and increased PI3K activity. Molecular modeling based on our experimental results suggested that, in addition to the interaction interface between the NS1 SH3 binding motif 1 (AA 164-167) and p85beta Val-573, AA 137-142 in NS1 might interact with p85beta. Indeed, mutations of AA 141 and 142 in NS1 disrupted the interaction between NS1 and p85beta. Mutant virus PR8-NS1-141/142 was not able to activate Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, PI3K assays demonstrated that, in wild-type virus-infected cells, p85beta-associated PI3K activity was increased significantly. In contrast, in the mutant virus-infected cells containing mutant NS1 unable to interact with p85beta, the p85beta-associated PI3K activity up-regulation was not seen, suggesting that PI3K up-regulation is dependent upon the interaction between NS1 and p85beta. Competition experiments and the immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that NS1, p85beta, and p110 form a complex in cells. Finally, the mechanism by which binding of NS1 to p85beta regulates PI3K activity was discussed based on a predicted structural model of NS1-p85-p110 complex.},

abstract = {The NS1 protein from influenza A viruses contains a four amino acid sequence at its carboxyl terminus that is termed the PDZ-binding motif (PBM). The NS1 PBM is predicted to bind to cellular PDZ proteins and functions as a virulence determinant in infected mice. ESEV is the consensus PBM sequence of avian influenza viruses, while RSKV is the consensus sequence of human viruses. Current circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses encode an NS1 protein with the ESEV PBM. We identified cellular targets of the avian ESEV PBM and identified molecular mechanisms involved in its function. Using GST pull-down assays, we found that the ESEV PBM enables NS1 to associate with the PDZ proteins Scribble, Dlg1, MAGI-1, MAGI-2 and MAGI-3. Because Scribble possesses a pro-apoptotic activity, we investigated the interaction between NS1 and Scribble. The association between NS1 and Scribble is direct and requires the ESEV PBM and two Scribble PDZ domains. We constructed recombinant H3N2 viruses that encode an H6N6 avian virus NS1 protein with either an ESEV or mutant ESEA PBM, allowing an analysis of the ESEV PBM in infections in mammalian cells. The ESEV PBM enhanced viral replication up to four-fold. In infected cells, NS1 with the ESEV PBM relocalized Scribble into cytoplasmic puncta concentrated in perinuclear regions and also protected cells from apoptosis. In addition, the latter effect was eliminated by siRNA-mediated Scribble depletion. This study shows that one function of the avian ESEV PBM is to reduce apoptosis during infection through disruption of Scribble's pro-apoptotic function.},

abstract = {Recently we have shown that influenza A virus infection leads to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and that this cellular reaction is dependent on the expression of the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). These data also suggested that PI3K activation confers a virus-supporting activity at intermediate stages of the infection cycle. So far it is not known which process is regulated by the kinase that supports virus replication. It is well established that upon infection with influenza A virus, the expression of the viral NS1 keeps the induction of beta interferon and the apoptotic response within a tolerable limit. On a molecular basis, this activity of NS1 has been suggested to preclude the activation of cellular double-stranded RNA receptors as well as impaired modulation of mRNA processing. Here we present a novel mode of action of the NS1 protein to suppress apoptosis induction. NS1 binds to and activates PI3K, which results in the activation of the PI3K effector Akt. This leads to a subsequent inhibition of caspase 9 and glycogen synthase-kinase 3beta and limitation of the virus-induced cell death program. Thus, NS1 not only blocks but also activates signaling pathways to ensure efficient virus replication.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that influenza A virus infection activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway by binding of influenza NS1 protein to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. Our previous study proposed that two polyproline motifs in NS1 (amino acids 164 to 167 [PXXP], SH3 binding motif 1, and amino acids 213 to 216 [PPXXP], SH3 binding motif 2) may mediate binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K. Here we performed individual mutational analyses on these two motifs and demonstrated that SH3 binding motif 1 contributes to the interactions of NS1 with p85beta, whereas SH3 binding motif 2 is not required for this process. Mutant viruses carrying NS1 with mutations in SH3 binding motif 1 failed to interact with p85beta and induce the subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. Mutant virus bearing mutations in SH3 binding motif 2 exhibited similar phenotype as the wild-type (WT) virus. Furthermore, viruses with mutations in SH3 binding motif 1 induced more severe apoptosis than did the WT virus. Our data suggest that SH3 binding motif 1 in NS1 protein is required for NS1-p85beta interaction and PI3K/Akt activation. Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway is beneficial for virus replication by inhibiting virus induced apoptosis through phosphorylation of caspase-9.},

abstract = {A panel of influenza A viruses encoding mutant NS1 proteins was created in which a number of NS1 functions, including interactions with dsRNA, PI3K, CPSF30 and PKR, were inhibited. Surprisingly, given previous reports that NS1 activates PI3K to prevent apoptosis, the mutant viruses rUd-Y89F and rUd-P164/7A that fail to activate PI3K did not induce any more apoptosis than wild-type virus in MRC-5 and A549 cells, even though these cells are highly sensitive to inducers of apoptosis. Induction of cell death by the apoptogenic rUd-184-8(P) virus could not be prevented by serum-mediated activation of PI3K/Akt. Neither infection of MRC-5 or A549 cells with wild-type virus nor constitutive expression of NS1 prevented cell death caused by apoptosis inducers, suggesting that NS1 is not directly anti-apoptotic. Our data suggest that the loss of a functionally intact NS1 protein promotes apoptosis, but this is not due to an inability to activate PI3K. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We assessed the prediction that access of the viral NS1 protein to cellular PDZ domain protein networks enhances the virulence of highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. The NS1 proteins of most avian influenza viruses bear the C-terminal ligand sequence Glu-Ser-Glu-Val (ESEV) for PDZ domains present in multiple host proteins, whereas no such motif is found in the NS1 homologues of seasonal human virus strains. Previous analysis showed that a C-terminal ESEV motif increases viral virulence when introduced into the NS1 protein of mouse-adapted H1N1 influenza virus. To examine the role of the PDZ domain ligand motif in avian influenza virus virulence, we generated three recombinants, derived from the prototypic H5N1 influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus, expressing NS1 proteins that either have the C-terminal ESEV motif or the human influenza virus RSKV consensus or bear a natural truncation of this motif, respectively. Cell biological analyses showed strong control of NS1 nuclear migration in infected mammalian and avian cells, with only minor differences between the three variants. The ESEV sequence attenuated viral replication on cultured human, murine, and duck cells but not on chicken fibroblasts. However, all three viruses caused highly lethal infections in mice and chickens, with little difference in viral titers in organs, mean lethal dose, or intravenous pathogenicity index. These findings demonstrate that a PDZ domain ligand sequence in NS1 contributes little to the virulence of H5N1 viruses in these hosts, and they indicate that this motif modulates viral replication in a strain- and host-dependent manner.},

abstract = {Seasonal epidemics and periodic worldwide pandemics caused by influenza A viruses are of continuous concern. The viral nonstructural (NS1) protein is a multifunctional virulence factor that antagonizes several host innate immune defenses during infection. NS1 also directly stimulates class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, an essential cell survival pathway commonly mutated in human cancers. Here, we present a 2.3-A resolution crystal structure of the NS1 effector domain in complex with the inter-SH2 (coiled-coil) domain of p85beta, a regulatory subunit of PI3K. Our data emphasize the remarkable isoform specificity of this interaction, and provide insights into the mechanism by which NS1 activates the PI3K (p85beta:p110) holoenzyme. A model of the NS1:PI3K heterotrimeric complex reveals that NS1 uses the coiled-coil as a structural tether to sterically prevent normal inhibitory contacts between the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85beta and the p110 catalytic subunit. Furthermore, in this model, NS1 makes extensive contacts with the C2/kinase domains of p110, and a small acidic alpha-helix of NS1 sits adjacent to the highly basic activation loop of the enzyme. During infection, a recombinant influenza A virus expressing NS1 with charge-disruption mutations in this acidic alpha-helix is unable to stimulate the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate or the phosphorylation of Akt. Despite this, the charge-disruption mutations in NS1 do not affect its ability to interact with the p85beta inter-SH2 domain in vitro. Overall, these data suggest that both direct binding of NS1 to p85beta (resulting in repositioning of the N-terminal SH2 domain) and possible NS1:p110 contacts contribute to PI3K activation.},

abstract = {PI3k-Akt and p53 pathways are known to play anti- and pro-apoptotic roles in cell death, respectively. Whether these pathways are recruited in influenza virus infection in highly productive monkey (CV-1) and canine (MDCK) kidney cells was studied here. Phosphorylation of Akt (Akt-pho) was found to occur only early after infection (5-9 h.p.i). Nuclear accumulation and phosphorylation of p53 (p53-pho), and expression of its natural target p21/waf showed low constitutive levels at this period, whereas all three parameters were markedly elevated at the late apoptotic stage (17-20 h.p.i.). Up-regulation of Akt-pho and p53-pho was not induced by UV-inactivated virus suggesting that it required virus replication. Also, mRNAs of p53 and its natural antagonist mdm2 were not increased throughout infection indicating that p53-pho was up-regulated by posttranslational mechanisms. However, p53 activation did not seem to play a leading role in influenza-induced cell death: (i) infection of CV1 and MDCK cells with recombinant NS1-deficient virus provoked accelerated apoptotic death characterized by the lack of p53 activation; (ii) mixed apoptosis-necrosis death developed in influenza-infected human bronchial H1299 cells carrying a tetracycline-regulated p53 gene did not depend on p53 gene activation by tetracycline. Virus-induced apoptosis and signaling of Akt and p53 developed in IFN-deficient VERO cells with similar kinetics as in IFN-competent CV1-infected cells indicating that these processes were endocrine IFN-independent. Apoptosis in influenza-infected CV-1 and MDCK cells was Akt-dependent and was accelerated by Ly294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3k-Akt signaling, and down-regulated by the viral protein NS1, an inducer of host Akt. The obtained data suggest that influenza virus (i) initiates anti-apoptotic PI3k-Akt signaling at early and middle phases of infection to protect cells from fast apoptotic death and (ii) provokes both p53-dependent and alternative p53-independent apoptotic and/or necrotic (in some host systems) cell death at the late stage of infection.},

abstract = {More than a decade ago, three viral oncoproteins, adenovirus type 9 E4-ORF1, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax, and high-risk human papillomavirus E6, were found to encode a related carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) that mediates interactions with a select group of cellular PDZ proteins. Recent studies have shown that many other viruses also encode PBM-containing proteins that bind to cellular PDZ proteins. Interestingly, these recently recognized viruses include not only some with oncogenic potential (hepatitis B virus, rhesus papillomavirus, cottontail rabbit papillomavirus) but also many without this potential (influenza virus, Dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, rabies virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus). Examination of the cellular PDZ proteins that are targets of viral PBMs reveals that the viral proteins often interact with the same or similar types of PDZ proteins, most notably Dlg1 and other members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family, as well as Scribble. In addition, cellular PDZ protein targets of viral PBMs commonly control tight junction formation, cell polarity establishment, and apoptosis. These findings reveal a new theme in virology wherein many different virus families encode proteins that bind and perturb the function of cellular PDZ proteins. The inhibition or perturbation of the function of cellular PDZ proteins appears to be a widely used strategy for viruses to enhance their replication, disseminate in the host, and transmit to new hosts.},

abstract = {The non-structural protein 1 (A/NS1) of influenza A viruses (IAV) harbours several src-homology domain (SH) binding motifs that are required for interaction with cellular proteins. The SH3 binding motif at aa212-217 [PPLPPK] of A/NS1 was shown to be essential for binding to the cellular adaptor proteins CRK and CRKL. Both regulate diverse cellular effector pathways, including activation of the MAP-kinase JNK that in turn mediates antiviral responses to IAV infection. By studying functional consequences of A/NS1-CRK interaction we show here that A/NS1 binding to CRK contributes to suppression of the antiviral-acting JNK-ATF2 pathway. However, only IAV that encode an A/NS1-protein harbouring the CRK/CRKL SH3 binding motif PPLPPK were attenuated upon downregulation of CRKI/II and CRKL, but not of CRKII alone. The PPLPPK site-harbouring candidate strains could be discriminated from other strains by a pronounced viral activation of the JNK-ATF2 signalling module that was even further boosted upon knock-down of CRKI/II. Interestingly, this enhanced JNK activation did not alter type-I IFN-expression, but rather resulted in increased levels of virus-induced cell death. Our results imply that binding capacity of A/NS1 to CRK/CRKL has evolved in virus strains that over-induce the antiviral acting JNK-ATF2 signalling module and helps to suppress the detrimental apoptosis promoting action of this pathway.},

abstract = {PB1-F2, a protein encoded by a second open reading frame of the influenza virus RNA segment 2, has emerged as a modulator of lung inflammatory responses but the molecular mechanisms underlying this are only poorly understood. Here we show that PB1-F2 inhibits the activation of NF-$\kappa$B dependent signalling pathways in luciferase reporter assays. PB1-F2 proteins from four different viruses interact with IKK$\beta$ in yeast two-hybrid assays and by co-immunoprecipitation. PB1-F2 expression did not inhibit IKK$\beta$ kinase activity or NF-$\kappa$B translocation into the nucleus, but NF-$\kappa$B binding to DNA was severely impaired in PB1-F2 transfected cells as assessed by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay. Neither the N-terminal 57 amino acid truncated forms nor the C-terminus of PB1-F2 were able to inhibit NF-$\kappa$B dependent signalling, indicating that the full length protein is necessary for the inhibition.},

@article{Matsuda2010,
abstract = {Avian influenza viruses belong to the genus influenza A virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. The influenza virus consists of eight segmented minus stranded RNA that encode 11 known proteins. Among the 11 viral proteins, NS1 (non-structural protein 1, encoded on segment 8) has been implicated in the regulation of several important intra-cellular functions. In this report, we investigated the functional interaction of NS1 with serine threonine kinase Akt, a core intra-cellular survival regulator. In co-immunoprecipitation assays and GST pull-down assays, NS1 directly interacted with Akt. The interaction was mediated primarily through the Akt-PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain and the RNA-binding domain of NS1. NS1 preferentially interacted with phosphorylated Akt, but not with non-phosphorylated Akt. Functionally, the NS1-Akt interaction enhanced Akt activity both in the intra-cellular context and in in vitro Akt kinase assays. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that phosphorylated Akt interacted with NS1 during the interphase of the cell cycle predominantly within the nucleus. Finally, mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated the position at Thr215 of NS1 protein is primary phosphorylation target site through Akt activation. The results together supported the functional importance of influenza virus NS1 with Akt, a core intra-cellular survival regulator.},

@article{Hrincius2011,
abstract = {The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) was identified to be activated upon influenza A virus (IAV) infection. An early and transient induction of PI3K signalling is caused by viral attachment to cells and promotes virus entry. In later phases of infection the kinase is activated by the viral NS1 protein to prevent premature apoptosis. Besides these virus supporting functions, it was suggested that PI3K signalling is involved in dsRNA and IAV induced antiviral responses by enhancing the activity of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3). However, molecular mechanisms of activation remained obscure. Here we show that accumulation of vRNA in cells infected with influenza A or B viruses results in PI3K activation. Furthermore, expression of the RNA receptors Rig-I and MDA5 was increased upon stimulation with virion extracted vRNA or IAV infection. Using siRNA approaches, Rig-I was identified as pathogen receptor necessary for influenza virus vRNA sensing and subsequent PI3K activation in a TRIM25 and MAVS signalling dependent manner. Rig-I induced PI3K signalling was further shown to be essential for complete IRF-3 activation and consequently induction of the type I interferon response. These data identify PI3K as factor that is activated as part of the Rig-I mediated anti-pathogen response to enhance expression of type I interferons.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus NS1 protein contains a conserved 4-amino-acid-residue PDZ-ligand binding motif (PBM) at the carboxyl terminus that can function as a virulence determinant by targeting cellular PDZ proteins. The NS1 proteins from avian and human viral isolates have consensus PBM sequences ESEV and RSKV, respectively. Currently circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses contain the ESEV PBM which specifically associates with the PDZ proteins Scribble, Dlg1, MAGI-1, MAGI-2, and MAGI-3. In this study, we found NS1 proteins from viral isolates that contain the PBM sequence RSKV, KSEV, or EPEV are unable to associate with these PDZ proteins. Other results showed that the ESEV PBM mediates an indirect association with PDZ protein, Lin7C, via an interaction with Dlg1. Infection with a virus that expresses a NS1 protein with the ESEV PBM results in colocalization of NS1, Scribble, and Dlg1 within perinuclear puncta and mislocalization of plasma membrane-associated Lin7C to the cytoplasm. Infection of polarized MDCK cells with the ESEV virus additionally results in functional disruption of the tight junction (TJ) as measured by altered localization of TJ markers ZO-1 and Occludin, decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and increased fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-inulin diffusion across the polarized cell monolayer. A similar effect on the TJ was observed in MDCK cells depleted for either Scribble or Dlg1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA). These findings indicate that ESEV PBM-mediated binding of NS1 to Scribble and Dlg1 functions to disrupt the cellular TJ and that this effect likely contributes to the severe disease associated with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses.},

abstract = {NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) is an important virulence factor of the influenza A virus. We observed that NS1 proteins of the 1918 pandemic virus (A/Brevig Mission/1/18) and many avian influenza A viruses contain a consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding motif. Screening of a comprehensive human SH3 phage library revealed the N-terminal SH3 of Crk and CrkL as the preferred binding partners. Studies with recombinant proteins confirmed avid binding of NS1 proteins of the 1918 virus and a representative avian H7N3 strain to Crk/CrkL SH3 but not to other SH3 domains tested, including p85alpha and p85beta. Endogenous CrkL readily co-precipitated NS1 from cells infected with the H7N3 virus. In transfected cells association with CrkL was observed for NS1 of the 1918 and H7N3 viruses but not A/Udorn/72 or A/WSN/33 NS1 lacking this sequence motif. SH3 binding was dispensable for suppression of interferon-induced gene expression by NS1 but was associated with enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, as evidenced by increased Akt phosphorylation. Thus, the Spanish Flu virus resembles avian influenza A viruses in its ability to recruit Crk/CrkL to modulate host cell signaling.},

@article{Hale2008d,
abstract = {Influenza A virus NS1 protein stimulates host-cell phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling by binding to the p85beta regulatory subunit of PI3K. Here, in an attempt to establish a mechanism for this activation, we report further on the functional interaction between NS1 and p85beta. Complex formation was found to be independent of NS1 RNA binding activity and is mediated by the C-terminal effector domain of NS1. Intriguingly, the primary direct binding site for NS1 on p85beta is the inter-SH2 domain, a coiled-coil structure that acts as a scaffold for the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K. In vitro kinase activity assays, together with protein binding competition studies, reveal that NS1 does not displace p110 from the inter-SH2 domain, and indicate that NS1 can form an active heterotrimeric complex with PI3K. In addition, it was established that residues at the C terminus of the inter-SH2 domain are essential for mediating the interaction between p85beta and NS1. Equivalent residues in p85alpha have previously been implicated in the basal inhibition of p110. However, such p85alpha residues were unable to substitute for those in p85beta with regards NS1 binding. Overall, these data suggest a model by which NS1 activates PI3K catalytic activity by masking a normal regulatory element specific to the p85beta inter-SH2 domain.},
