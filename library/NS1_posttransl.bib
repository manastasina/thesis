abstract = {2',5'-Oligoadenylate synthetase (2',5'-OAS) was discovered and characterized as an interferon (IFN)-induced enzyme that in the presence of double-stranded (ds) RNA converts ATP into 2',5'-linked oligomers of adenosine with the general formula pppA(2'p'A)n, n > or = 1. The product is pppG2'p5'G when GTP is used as a substrate. Now, 20 years later, this activity is attributed to several well-characterized, homologous, and IFN-induced proteins in human cells. Three distinct forms of 2',5'-OAS exist, small, medium, and large, which contain 1, 2, and 3 OAS units, respectively, and are encoded by distinct genes clustered on the 2',5'-OAS locus on human chromosome 12. Recently, other IFN-induced proteins homologous to the OAS unit but devoid of the typical 2',5'-OAS catalytic activity have been described. These OAS-related proteins are encoded by a gene located at the proximity of the 2',5'-OAS locus. These findings illustrate the apparent structural and functional complexity of the human 2',5'-OAS family.},

The three subunits of the polymerase and the nucleoprotein, but not M1 protein, were co-immunoprecipitated by NS1-specific serum but not when control serum was used. Such co-immunoprecipitation was not sensitive to RNase treatment of the immunoprecipitates. Co-immunoprecipitation was also obtained when the viral transcription-replication system was reconstituted in vivo by transfection of cDNAs and model vRNA template into vaccinia virus-T7-infected cells.

These viruses were temperature sensitive and showed a small plaque size at the permissive temperature. The accumulation of virion RNA in mutant virus-infected cells was reduced at the restrictive temperature, while the accumulation of cRNA or mRNA was not affected, indicating that the NS1 protein is involved in the control of transcription versus replication processes in the infection. The synthesis and accumulation of late virus proteins were reduced in NS1-81 mutant-infected cells at the permissive temperature and were essentially abolished for both viruses at the restrictive temperature, while synthesis and accumulation of nucleoprotein (NP) were unaffected. Probably as a consequence, the nucleocytoplasmic export of virus NP was strongly inhibited at the restrictive temperature. These results indicate that the NS1 protein is essential for nuclear and cytoplasmic steps during the virus cycle.},

abstract = {The NS1 protein of influenza A virus binds not only to poly(A) and a stem-bulge region in U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), but also to double-stranded (ds) RNA. Binding assays with NS1 protein mutants established that the previously identified RNA-binding domain of the NS1 protein is required for binding to ds RNA as well as for binding to poly(A) and U6 snRNA. In addition, dsRNA competed with U6 snRNA for binding to the NS1 protein, consistent with both RNAs sharing the same binding site on the protein. As a consequence of its binding to dsRNA, the NS1 protein blocks the activation of the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) in vitro. This kinase phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (elF-2 alpha), leading to a decrease in the rate of initiation of translation. Assays using purified PKR and purified elF2 demonstrated that the NS1 protein blocks the dsRNA activation of PKR, and experiments using reticulocyte extracts showed that the NS1 protein blocks the inhibition of translation caused by dsRNA activation of PKR. The implications of these results for control mechanisms occurring in influenza virus-infected cells are discussed.},

abstract = {We describe a new approach to elucidate the role of 3'-end processing in pre-mRNA splicing in vivo using the influenza virus NS1A protein. The effector domain of the NS1A protein, which inhibits the function of the CPSF and PABII factors of the cellular 3'-end-processing machinery, is sufficient for the inhibition of not only 3'-end formation but also the splicing of single-intron pre-mRNAs in vivo. We demonstrate that inhibition of the splicing of single-intron pre-mRNAs results from inhibition of 3'-end processing, thereby establishing that 3'-end processing is required for the splicing of a 3' terminal intron in vivo. Because the NS1A protein causes a global suppression of 3'-end processing in trans, we avoid the ambiguities caused by the activation of cryptic poly(A) sites that occurs when mutations are introduced into the AAUAAA sequence in the pre-mRNA. In addition, this strategy enabled us to establish that the function of a particular 3'-end-processing factor, namely CPSF, is required for the splicing of single-intron pre-mRNAs in vivo: splicing is inhibited only when the effector domain of the NS1A protein binds and inhibits the function of the 30-kDa CPSF protein in 3'-end formation. In contrast, the 3'-end processing factor PABII is not required for splicing. We discuss the implications of these results for cellular and influenza viral mRNA splicing.},

abstract = {We investigated the mechanisms by which influenza virus prevents shutoff of protein synthesis by a cellular protein kinase normally activated during infection. Earlier work has shown that influenza virus superinfection of cells previously infected by the adenovirus VAI RNA-negative mutant dl331 resulted in selective translation of influenza virus mRNAs and suppression of the elevated protein kinase levels normally found in cells infected by the mutant alone (M. G. Katze, B. M. Detjen, B. Safer, and R. M. Krug, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:1741-1750, 1986). We elucidated the mechanisms of this kinase repression and can now report that influenza virus encodes a gene product which functions to directly block the autophosphorylation and activity of the interferon-induced, double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase, P68. Suppressed P68 activity was found not only in doubly infected cells but also in cells infected by influenza virus alone. Moreover, the decrease in P68 activity correlated with a decrease in the endogenous levels of phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the eucaryotic initiation factor eIF-2, the natural substrate of the protein kinase. Suppression of P68 activity occurred as early as 2 h after influenza virus infection and required viral gene expression beyond the level of primary mRNA transcription to take place. We confirmed our in vivo observations with in vitro mixing experiments which showed that the influenza virus inhibitor can act in trans to block P68 activity. Combined repression of P68 function and eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation during influenza virus infection is essential for continued catalytic recycling of eIF-2 and efficient mRNA translation.},

abstract = {A short model genome RNA and also the genome RNA of influenza A virus bearing both 5'- and 3'-terminal common sequences activated the interferon-induced double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, by stimulating autophosphorylation in vitro. The activated PKR catalyzed phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eucaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). The NS1 protein efficiently eliminated the PKR-activating activity of these RNAs by binding to them. Two mutant NS1 proteins, each harboring a single amino acid substitution at different regions, exhibited temperature sensitivity in their RNA binding activity in the mutant virus-infected cell lysates as well as when they were prepared as fusion proteins expressed in bacteria. The virus strains carrying these mutant NS1 proteins exhibited temperature sensitivity in virus protein synthesis at the translational level, as reported previously, and could not repress the autophosphorylation of PKR developing during the virus growth, which is normally suppressed by a viral function(s). As a result, the level of eIF2alpha phosphorylation was elevated 2.5- to 3-fold. The defect in virus protein synthesis was well correlated with the level of phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2alpha.},

Although all ribonucleases of this superfamily share invariant structural and catalytic elements and some degree of enzymatic activity, the primary sequences have diverged significantly, ostensibly to promote novel function. We will review the literature on the evolution and biology of the RNase A ribonuclease lineages that have been characterized specifically as involved in host defense including: (1) RNases 2 and RNases 3, also known as the eosinophil ribonucleases, which are rapidly-evolving cationic proteins released from eosinophilic leukocytes, (2) RNase 7, an anti-pathogen ribonuclease identified in human skin, and (3) RNase 5, also known as angiogenin, another rapidly-evolving ribonuclease known to promote blood vessel growth with recently-discovered antibacterial activity. Interestingly, some of the characterized anti-pathogen activities do not depend on ribonuclease activity per se. We discuss the ways in which the anti-pathogen activities characterized in vitro might translate into experimental confirmation in vivo. We will also consider the possibility that other ribonucleases, such as the dimeric bovine seminal ribonuclease and the frog oocyte ribonucleases, may have host defense functions and therapeutic value that remain to be explored.

abstract = {Single-stranded M13 DNAs specific for various influenza virus genomic segments were used to analyze the synthesis of virus-specific RNAs in infected cells. The results show that influenza virus infection is divided into two distinct phases. During the early phase, the syntheses of specific virion RNAs, viral mRNAs, and viral proteins were coupled. Thus, the NS (nonstructural) virion RNA was preferentially synthesized early, leading to the preferential synthesis of NS1 viral mRNA and NS1 protein; in contrast, M (matrix) RNA synthesis was delayed, leading to the delayed synthesis of M1 viral mRNA and M1 protein. This phase lasted for 2.5 h in BHK-21 cells, the time at which the rate of synthesis of all the viral mRNAs was maximal. During the second phase, the synthesis of all the virion RNAs remained at or near maximum until at least 5.5 h postinfection, whereas the rate of synthesis of all the viral mRNAs declined dramatically. By 4.5 h, the rate of synthesis of all the viral mRNAs was 5\% of the maximum rate. Viral mRNA and protein syntheses were also not coupled, as the synthesis of all the viral proteins continued at maximum levels, indicating that protein synthesis during this phase was directed principally by previously synthesized viral mRNAs. Short pulses (3 min) with [3H]uridine and nonaqueous fractionation of cells were used to show that influenza virion RNA synthesis occurred in the nucleus, demonstrating that all virus-specific RNA synthesis was nuclear. Virion RNAs, like viral mRNAs, were efficiently transported to the cytoplasm at both early and late times of infection. In contrast, the full-length transcripts of the virion RNAs, which are the templates for virion RNA synthesis, were sequestered in the nucleus. Thus, the template RNAs, which were synthesized only at early times, remained in the nucleus to direct virion RNA synthesis throughout infection. These results enabled us to present an overall scheme for the control of influenza virus gene expression.},

This crystal structure of a 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase reveals a structural conservation with the 3'-specific poly(A) polymerase that, coupled with structure-guided mutagenesis, supports a conserved catalytic mechanism for the 2'- and 3'-specific nucleotidyl transferases. Comparison with structures of other superfamily members indicates that the donor substrates are bound by conserved active site features while the acceptor substrates are oriented by nonconserved regions. The 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetases are activated by viral double-stranded RNA in infected cells and initiate a cellular response by synthesizing 2'-5'-oligoadenylates, which in turn activate RNase L. This crystal structure suggests that activation involves a domain-domain shift and identifies a putative dsRNA activation site that is probed by mutagenesis, thus providing structural insight into cellular recognition of viral double-stranded RNA.},

abstract = {The interferon (IFN)-induced protein kinase (PKR) functions as a gatekeeper of mRNA translation initiation and is, therefore, a key mediator of the host IFN-induced antiviral defense system. Many viruses have invested countermeasures against PKR. Some apparently use more than one mechanism. The influenza virus can repress PKR activity through the use of at least two factors, the cellular P58IPK protein and the viral NS1 protein. The exact mode of action of the latter has not been established. Here, using a coprecipitation assay, we found that PKR could form a complex with NS1 in crude cell extracts prepared from influenza virus-infected HeLa cells. The NS1-PKR interaction was verified by using the yeast two-hybrid system and an in vitro binding assay. Deletion analysis mapped the NS1 binding site to the N-terminal 98 residues of PKR regulatory region. Furthermore, an NS1 mutant, which lacks PKR inhibitory activity, did not bind PKR. Finally, the functional role of NS1 in PKR inhibition was substantiated using an in vivo assay for PKR activity. These results support the role of NS1 in PKR modulation during viral infection that is mediated through a complex formation between the two proteins.},

abstract = {The NS1 protein of influenza A virus (NS1A protein) is a multifunctional protein that counters cellular antiviral activities and is a virulence factor. Its N-terminal RNA-binding domain binds dsRNA. The only amino acid absolutely required for dsRNA binding is the R at position 38. To identify the role of this dsRNA-binding activity during influenza A virus infection, we generated a recombinant influenza A/Udorn/72 virus expressing an NS1A protein containing an RNA-binding domain in which R38 is mutated to A. This R38A mutant virus is highly attenuated, and the mutant NS1A protein, like the WT protein, is localized in the nucleus. Using the R38A mutant virus, we establish that dsRNA binding by the NS1A protein does not inhibit production of IFN-beta mRNA. Rather, we demonstrate that the primary role of this dsRNA-binding activity is to protect the virus against the antiviral state induced by IFN-beta. Pretreatment of A549 cells with IFN-beta for 6 h did not inhibit replication of WT Udorn virus, whereas replication of R38A mutant virus was inhibited 1,000-fold. Using both RNA interference in A549 cells and mouse knockout cells, we show that this enhanced sensitivity to IFN-beta-induced antiviral activity is due predominantly to the activation of RNase L. Because activation of RNase L is totally dependent on dsRNA activation of 2'-5' oligo (A) synthetase (OAS), it is likely that the primary role of dsRNA binding by the NS1A protein in virus-infected cells is to sequester dsRNA away from 2'-5' OAS.},

abstract = {Selective translation of influenza viral mRNAs occurs after influenza virus superinfection of cells infected with the VAI RNA-negative adenovirus mutant dl331 (M. G. Katze, Y.-T. Chen, and R. M. Krug, Cell 37:483-490, 1984). Cell extracts from these doubly infected cells catalyze the initiation of essentially only influenza viral protein synthesis, reproducing the in vivo situation. This selective translation is correlated with a 5- to 10-fold suppression of the dl331-induced kinase that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eucaryotic initiation factor eIF-2. This strongly suggests that influenza virus encodes a gene product that, analogous to the adenoviral VAI RNA, prevents the shutdown of overall protein synthesis caused by an eIF-2 alpha kinase turned on by viral infection. Adenoviral mRNA translation was restored to the extract from the doubly infected cells by the addition of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF-2B, which is responsible for the normal recycling of eIF-2 during protein synthesis. This indicates that the residual kinase in the doubly infected cells leads to a limitation in functional (nonsequestered) eIF-2B and hence functional (GTP-containing) eIF-2 and that under these conditions influenza viral mRNAs are selectively translated over adenoviral mRNAs. Addition of double-stranded RNA to the extracts from these cells restored the eIF-2 alpha kinase to a level approaching that seen in extracts from cells infected with dl331 alone and caused the inhibition of influenza viral mRNA translation. This suggests that the putative influenza viral gene product acts against the double-stranded RNA activation of the kinase and indicates that influenza viral mRNA translation is also linked to the level of functional eIF-2. Our results thus indicate that a limitation in functional eIF-2 which causes a nonspecific reduction in the rate of initiation of protein synthesis results in the preferential translation of the better mRNAs (influenza viral mRNAs) at the expense of the poorer mRNAs (adenoviral mRNAs).},

abstract = {Upon influenza A virus infection of cells, a wide variety of antiviral and virus-supportive signalling pathways are induced. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is a recent addition to the growing list of signalling mediators that are activated by these viruses. Several studies have addressed the role of PI3K and the downstream effector protein kinase Akt in influenza A virus-infected cells. PI3K/Akt signalling is activated by diverse mechanisms in a biphasic manner and is required for multiple functions during infection. While the kinase supports activation of the interferon regulatory factor-3 during antiviral interferon induction, it also exhibits virus supportive functions. In fact, PI3K not only regulates a very early step during viral entry but also results in suppression of premature apoptosis at later stages of infection. The latter function is dependent on the expression of the viral non-structural protein-1 (A/NS1). It has been shown that PI3K activation occurs by direct interaction of A/NS1 with the p85 regulatory subunit and interaction sites of A/NS1 and p85 have now been mapped in detail. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on influenza virus-induced PI3K signalling and how this pathway supports viral propagation.},

abstract = {Protein kinase R (PKR) is an interferon-induced kinase that plays a pivotal role  in the innate immunity response to viral infection. PKR is activated upon binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Our previous analysis of binding of PKR to dsRNAs ranging from 20 to 40 bp supports a dimerization model for activation in which 30 bp represents the minimal length required to bind two PKR monomers and activate PKR via autophosphorylation. These studies were complicated by the formation of protein-RNA aggregates, particularly at low salt concentrations using longer dsRNAs. Here, we have taken advantage of the enhanced sensitivity afforded using fluorescence-detected analytical ultracentrifugation to reduce the RNA concentrations from micromolar to nanomolar. Under these conditions, we are able to characterize high-affinity binding of PKR to longer dsRNAs in 75 mM NaCl. The PKR binding stoichiometries are increased at lower salt concentrations but remain lower than those previously obtained for the dsRNA binding domain. The dependence of the limiting PKR binding stoichiometries on dsRNA length does not conform to standard models for nonspecific binding and suggests that binding to longer sequences occurs via a different binding mode with a larger site size. Although dimerization plays a key role in the PKR activation mechanism, the ability of shorter dsRNAs to bind two PKR monomers is not sufficient to induce autophosphorylation. We propose that activation of PKR by longer RNAs is correlated with an alternative binding mode in which both of the dsRNA binding motifs contact the RNA, inducing PKR to dimerize via a direct interaction of the kinase domains.},

abstract = {A major component of the cellular antiviral system is the latent protein kinase PKR, which is activated by binding to either double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or the cellular PACT protein. Activated PKR phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2, thereby inhibiting viral and cellular protein synthesis and virus replication. To evade the antiviral effects of PKR, many viruses, including influenza A virus, have evolved multiple mechanisms. For influenza A virus, the non-structural (NS1A) protein plays a major role in blocking activation of PKR during virus infection. The mechanism by which the NS1A protein inhibits PKR activation in infected cells has not been established. In the present study, we first carried out a series of in vitro experiments to determine whether the NS1A protein could utilize a common mechanism to inhibit PKR activation by both PACT and dsRNA, despite their different modes of activation. We demonstrated that the direct binding of the NS1A protein to the N-terminal 230 amino acid region of PKR can serve as such a common mechanism and that this binding does not require the RNA-binding activity of the NS1A protein. The lack of requirement for NS1A RNA-binding activity for the inhibition of PKR activation in vivo was established by two approaches. First, we showed that an NS1A protein lacking RNA-binding activity, like the wild-type (wt) protein, blocked PKR activation by PACT in vivo, as well as the downstream effects of PKR activation in cells, namely, eIF2 phosphorylation and apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrated that PKR activation is inhibited in cells infected with a recombinant influenza A virus expressing NS1A mutant protein that cannot bind RNA, as is the case in cells infected with wild-type influenza A virus.},

abstract = {A screening for human proteins capable of interacting with influenza virus NS1 has been carried out using the two-hybrid genetic trap in yeast. A cDNA corresponding to the human homologue of Drosophila melanogaster Staufen protein (hStaufen) was isolated that fulfilled all genetic controls of the two-hybrid protocol. Using a hStaufen cDNA isolated from a lambda human library, the interaction of hStaufen and NS1 proteins was characterised in vivo and in vitro. Co-transfection of NS1 cDNA and a partial cDNA of hStaufen led to the relocalisation of recombinant hStaufen protein from its normal accumulation site in the cytoplasm to the nuclear location of NS1 protein. NS1 and hStaufen proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated from extracts of co-transfected cells and from mixtures of extracts containing either protein, as well as from extracts of influenza virus-infected cells. Furthermore, both proteins co-localised in the ribosomal and polysomal fractions of influenza virus-infected cells. The interaction was also detected in pull-down experiments using a resin containing purified hStaufen and NS1 protein translated in vitro. Deletion mapping of the NS1 gene indicated that a mutant protein containing the N-terminal 81 amino acids is unable to interact with hStaufen, in spite of retaining full RNA-binding capacity. These results are discussed in relation to the possible mechanisms of action of hStaufen and its relevance for influenza virus infection.},

abstract = {Infections with influenza A viruses result in the activation of a variety of intracellular signalling pathways. Recent findings suggest that in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is commonly used as a mimic for accumulating viral RNA, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is activated and mediates activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Thus, we investigated the function of PI3K during influenza virus infection. The pathway was activated upon infection and consistent with earlier findings using dsRNA, inhibition of PI3K itself or block of signalling by the PI3K product, the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), results in misphosphorylation and impaired dimerization of IRF-3 as well as reduced IRF-3-dependent promoter activity. This would imply an antiviral function of the kinase in influenza virus-infected cells. However, upon inhibition of PI3K, titers of progeny virus were reduced rather than enhanced. This was coincident with a strong decrease of viral protein accumulation that was not due to a block of protein synthesis or inhibition of the viral polymerase complex. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that PI3K rather appears to regulate a very early step during viral entry. Thus PI3K is a perfect example of a seemingly antiviral signalling component that is misused by the virus to support effective replication.},

abstract = {Influenza A viruses encoding an altered viral NS1 protein have emerged as promising live attenuated vaccine platforms. A carboxy-terminal truncation in the NS1 protein compromises its interferon antagonism activity, making these viruses attenuated in the host yet still able to induce protection from challenge with wild-type viruses. However, specific viral protein expression by NS1-truncated viruses is known to be decreased in infected cells. In this report, we show that recombinant H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses encoding a truncated NS1 protein expressed lower levels of hemagglutinin (HA) protein in infected cells than did wild-type viruses. This reduction in HA protein expression correlated with a reduction in HA mRNA levels in infected cells. NS1 truncation affected the expression of HA protein but not that of the nucleoprotein (NP). This segment specificity was mapped to the terminal sequences of their specific viral RNAs. Since the HA protein is the major immunogenic component in influenza virus vaccines, we sought to restore its expression levels in NS1-truncated viruses in order to improve their vaccine efficacy. For this purpose, we generated an NS1-truncated recombinant influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (rPR8) virus carrying the G3A C8U "superpromoter" mutations in the HA genomic RNA segment. This strategy retained the attenuation properties of the recombinant virus but enhanced the expression level of HA protein in infected cells. Finally, mice immunized with rPR8 viruses encoding a truncated NS1 protein and carrying the G3A C8U mutations in the HA segment demonstrated enhanced protection from wild-type virus challenge over that for mice vaccinated with an rPR8 virus encoding the truncated NS1 protein alone.},

abstract = {The 2-5A system is an established endogenous antiviral pathway. Interferon treatment of cells leads to an increase in basal, but latent, levels of 2-5A-dependent RNase (RNase L) and the family of 2'-5' oligoadenylate sythetases (OAS). Double-stranded RNA, thought to be derived from viral replication intermediates, activates OAS. Activated OAS converts ATP into unusual short 2'-5' linked oligoadenylates called 2-5A [ppp5'(A2'p5')2A]. The 2-5A binds to and activates RNase L which cleaves single stranded RNA with moderate specificity for sites 3' of UpUp and UpAp sequences, and thus leads to degradation of cellular rRNA. During apoptosis, generalized cellular RNA degradation, distinct from the differential expression of mRNA species that may regulate specific gene expression during apoptosis, has been observed. The mechanism of RNA breakdown during apoptosis has been commonly considered a non-specific event that reflects the generalized shut down of translation and homeostatic regulation during cell death. Due to the similar RNA degradation that occurs during both apoptosis and viral infection we investigated the potential role of RNase L in apoptosis. To investigate whether RNase L activity could lead to apoptosis, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with a lac-inducible vector containing the human RNase L gene. Treatment of these cells with isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) caused loss of cell viability that was confirmed as an apoptotic cell death by morphological and biochemical criteria. Similarly, specific allosteric activation of endogenous RNase L by introduction of 2-5A directly into L929 cells also induced apoptosis. In L929 cells poly(I),poly(C) treatment in combination with interferon caused an increase in apoptosis whereas neither interferon or double stranded RNA alone altered cell viability. Therefore, increased expression or activation of RNase L causes apoptosis. Inhibition of RNase L, specifically with a dominant negative mutant, suppressed poly (I)Ypoly(C)-induced apoptosis in interferon-primed fibroblasts. Poliovirus, a picornovirus with a single-stranded RNA genome, causes apoptosis of HeLa cells. Expression of the dominant negative inhibitor of RNase L in HeLa prevented virus-induced apoptosis and maintained cell viability. Thus, reduction or inhibition of RNase L activity prevents apoptosis. Both apoptosis and the 2-5A system can provide defense against vital infection in multicellular organisms by preventing production and therefore spread of progeny virus. RNase L appears to function in both mechanisms, therefore, initiation of apoptosis may be one mechanism for the antiviral activity of the 2-5A system.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus RNA synthesis is catalyzed by the viral polymerase comprised of the PA, PB1, and PB2 proteins. We show that the host DDX21 RNA helicase restricts influenza A virus by binding PB1 and inhibiting polymerase assembly, resulting in reduced viral RNA and protein synthesis. Later during infection, the viral NS1 protein overcomes this restriction by binding to DDX21 and displacing PB1. DDX21 binds to a region of the NS1 N-terminal domain that also participates in other critical functions. A virus mutant whose NS1 protein is unable to bind DDX21 exhibits reduced viral protein synthesis at both late and early times of infection, a phenotype converted to wild-type upon DDX21 knockdown. As sequential interaction of PB1 and NS1 with DDX21 leads to temporal regulation of viral gene expression, influenza A virus likely uses the DDX21-NS1 interaction not only to overcome restriction, but also to regulate the viral life cycle.},

abstract = {It is not known how influenza A viruses, important human pathogens, counter PKR activation, a crucial host antiviral response. Here we elucidate this mechanism. We show that the direct binding of PKR to the NS1 protein in vitro that results in inhibition of PKR activation requires the NS1 123-127 amino acid sequence. To establish whether such direct binding of PKR to the NS1 protein is responsible for inhibiting PKR activation in infected cells, we generated recombinant influenza A/Udorn/72 viruses expressing NS1 proteins in which amino acids 123/124 or 126/127 are changed to alanines. In cells infected with these mutant viruses, PKR is activated, eIF-2alpha is phosphorylated and viral protein synthesis is inhibited, indicating that direct binding of PKR to the 123-127 sequence of the NS1 protein is necessary and sufficient to block PKR activation in influenza A virus-infected cells. Unexpectedly, the 123/124 mutant virus is not attenuated because reduced viral protein synthesis is offset by enhanced viral RNA synthesis at very early times of infection. These early viral RNAs include those synthesized predominantly at later times during wild-type virus infection, demonstrating that wild-type temporal regulation of viral RNA synthesis is absent in 123/124 virus-infected cells. Enhanced early viral RNA synthesis after 123/124 virus infection also occurs in mouse PKR-/- cells, demonstrating that PKR activation and deregulation of the time course of viral RNA synthesis are not coupled. These results indicate that the 123/124 site of the NS1A protein most likely functionally interacts with the viral polymerase to mediate temporal regulation of viral RNA synthesis. This interaction would occur in the nucleus, whereas PKR would bind to NS1A proteins in the cytoplasm prior to their import into the nucleus.},
