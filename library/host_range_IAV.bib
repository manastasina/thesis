abstract = {Ample evidence suggests that all influenza viruses in mammals were probably derived from those in wild waterfowl at some time. In addition to those already established in mammals, the viruses have been transmitted to both mammals and to poultry from wild waterfowl and caused outbreaks in recent years. Experimentally, however, the viruses from one species of animals do not grow efficiently in other species. For example, human influenza viruses do not replicate in ducks or in horses, indicating their host range restriction. This paper reviews current knowledge on the host-range restriction of influenza viruses, focusing on the role of the hemagglutinin (HA). Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of the H7N9 avian influenza A virus and its ability to infect humans emphasize the epidemic and pandemic potential of these viruses. Interspecies transmission is the result of many factors, which ultimately lead to a change in the host tropism of the virus. One of the key factors involved is a shift in the receptor-binding specificity of the virus, which is mostly determined by mutations in the viral haemagglutinin (HA). In this Review, we discuss recent crystallographic studies that provide molecular insights into HA-host receptor interactions that have enabled several influenza A virus subtypes to 'jump' from avian to human hosts.},

abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses remain a significant health threat to humans given the continued rare occurrence of human cases with a high case fatality rate. This brief literature review summarizes available evidence of risk factors for H5N1 infection in humans and updates a recent systematic review published in early 2011. Several epidemiologic studies have been published to evaluate the risk factors for H5N1 infection in humans, including contact with poultry and poultry products and non-poultry-related contact such as from H5N1-contaminated water. While most H5N1 cases are attributed to exposure to sick poultry, it is unclear how many may be due to human-to-human transmission. The collective results of published literature suggest that transmission risk of H5N1 from poultry to humans may be highest among individuals who may have been in contact with the highest potential concentrations of virus shed by poultry. This suggests that there may be a threshold of virus concentration needed for effective transmission and that circulating H5N1 strains have not yet mutated to transmit readily from either poultry to human or from human to human. However, the mode of potential transmission can be quite varied throughout different countries and by study with exposures ranging from visiting a wet market, preparing infected poultry for consumption, to swimming or bathing in ponds frequented by poultry. Several important data gaps remain in the understanding of the epidemiology of H5N1 in humans and limit our ability to interpret the results of the available H5N1 seroepidemiologic studies.},

abstract = {Avian influenza (AI) virus is one of the most important diseases of the poultry industry around the world. The virus has a broad host range in birds and mammals, although the natural reservoir is wild birds where it typically causes an asymptomatic to mild infection. The virus in poultry can cause a range of clinical diseases and is defined either as low pathogenic AI (LPAI) or highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) depending on the type of disease it causes in chickens. Viruses that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces and cause mild disease with low mortality are termed LPAI. Viruses that replicate on mucosal surfaces and systemically and cause severe disease with a mortality rate of 75\% or greater in experimentally infected chickens are referred to as HPAI. A virus that is highly pathogenic in chickens may infect but result in a completely different disease and replication pattern in other host species. Outbreaks of HPAI have been relatively uncommon around the world in the last 50 years and have had limited spread within a country or region with one major exception, Asian lineage H5N1 that was first identified in 1996. This lineage of virus has spread to over 60 countries and has become endemic in poultry in at least four countries. AI virus also represents a public health threat, with some infected humans having severe disease and with a high case fatality rate. AI remains a difficult disease to control because of the highly infectious nature of the virus and the interface of domestic and wild animals. A better understanding of the disease and its transmission is important for control.},

@article{Webster1992a,
abstract = {In this review we examine the hypothesis that aquatic birds are the primordial source of all influenza viruses in other species and study the ecological features that permit the perpetuation of influenza viruses in aquatic avian species. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of influenza A virus RNA segments coding for the spike proteins (HA, NA, and M2) and the internal proteins (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) from a wide range of hosts, geographical regions, and influenza A virus subtypes support the following conclusions. (i) Two partly overlapping reservoirs of influenza A viruses exist in migrating waterfowl and shorebirds throughout the world. These species harbor influenza viruses of all the known HA and NA subtypes. (ii) Influenza viruses have evolved into a number of host-specific lineages that are exemplified by the NP gene and include equine Prague/56, recent equine strains, classical swine and human strains, H13 gull strains, and all other avian strains. Other genes show similar patterns, but with extensive evidence of genetic reassortment. Geographical as well as host-specific lineages are evident. (iii) All of the influenza A viruses of mammalian sources originated from the avian gene pool, and it is possible that influenza B viruses also arose from the same source. (iv) The different virus lineages are predominantly host specific, but there are periodic exchanges of influenza virus genes or whole viruses between species, giving rise to pandemics of disease in humans, lower animals, and birds. (v) The influenza viruses currently circulating in humans and pigs in North America originated by transmission of all genes from the avian reservoir prior to the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic; some of the genes have subsequently been replaced by others from the influenza gene pool in birds. (vi) The influenza virus gene pool in aquatic birds of the world is probably perpetuated by low-level transmission within that species throughout the year. (vii) There is evidence that most new human pandemic strains and variants have originated in southern China. (viii) There is speculation that pigs may serve as the intermediate host in genetic exchange between influenza viruses in avian and humans, but experimental evidence is lacking. (ix) Once the ecological properties of influenza viruses are understood, it may be possible to interdict the introduction of new influenza viruses into humans.},

abstract = {Although wild birds are the recognized source and reservoir for all subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIV), the complex interaction among these diverse host and virus populations has not received adequate attention. A general concept of AIV epidemiology in wild birds exists; however, the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses in wild birds has reinforced the need for a much more detailed understanding of AIV natural history. Worldwide, the wild avian reservoirs for AIV are incompletely defined, even within well-studied groups such as the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. This lack of clarity applies not only to avian host species, but also to the various subtypes of AIV present within these populations. Even with the extensive number of AIV isolations previously reported from wild birds, the reservoir species and global distribution for many of these AIV subtypes are not completely understood. To date, studies related to AIV epidemiology in wild birds primarily focused on the agent. To move forward, we need to apply this same level of scrutiny and detailed understanding to the natural host populations and the environments they utilize. Research to date clearly demonstrates that species and population structure are important in AIV maintenance, transmission, and possibly long-distance movement. Species-related differences related to general behavior, spatial and temporal distribution, habitat utilization, migration behavior, population age structure, and individual species susceptibility all potentially influence a species’ role in AIV epidemiology. The unprecedented mortality associated with HPAI H5N1 infection in wild birds provides a new window from which to view the potential for exchange of AIV between wild and domestic birds, and further demonstrates and expands the varied roles that wild birds may play in AIV epidemiology. These roles must be clearly defined if we are going understand the full implications of current HPAI H5N1 virus introduction into the wild bird populations and most importantly prevent the next one.},

abstract = {Influenza A viruses cause pandemics at random intervals. Pandemics are caused by viruses that contain a hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein to which human populations are immunologically naive. Such an HA can be introduced into the human population through reassortment between human and avian virus strains or through the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus to humans. The factors that determine the interspecies transmission and pathogenicity of influenza viruses are still poorly understood; however, the HA protein plays an important role in overcoming the interspecies barrier and in virulence in avian influenza viruses. Recently, the RNA polymerase (PB2) protein has also been recognized as a critical factor in host range restriction, while the nonstructural (NS1) protein affects the initial host immune responses. We summarize current knowledge of viral factors that determine host range restriction and pathogenicity of influenza A viruses.},
