abstract = {The influenza virus NS1 protein was shown to stimulate translation of the M1 protein. M-CAT RNA, which contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and the terminal noncoding sequence of segment 7 (coding for the M1 and M2 proteins), was ribonucleoprotein transfected into clone 76 cells expressing the influenza virus RNA polymerase and NP proteins required for the transcription and replication of influenza virus ribonucleoproteins. When the cells were superinfected with a recombinant vaccinia virus which expresses the NS1 protein, CAT expression from the M-CAT RNA was significantly stimulated but transcription was not altered. The expression of NS-CAT RNA, which contains noncoding sequences of segment 8 (coding for the NS1 and NS2 proteins), was not altered by the NS1 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the sequence GGUAGAUA upstream of the initiation codon on segment 7 was required for stimulation.},

abstract = {Recent advances in life science have led to great motivation for the development of protein arrays to study functions of genome-encoded proteins. While traditional cell-based methods have been commonly used for generating protein arrays, they are usually a time-consuming process with a number of technical challenges. Cell-free protein synthesis offers an attractive system for making protein arrays, not only does it rapidly converts the genetic information into functional proteins without the need for DNA cloning, but also presents a flexible environment amenable to production of folded proteins or proteins with defined modifications. Recent advancements have made it possible to rapidly generate protein arrays from PCR DNA templates through parallel on-chip protein synthesis. This article reviews current cell-free protein array technologies and their proteomic applications.},

@article{Yin2007,
abstract = {Influenza A viruses cause a highly contagious respiratory disease in humans and are responsible for periodic widespread epidemics with high mortality rates. The influenza A virus NS1 protein (NS1A) plays a key role in countering host antiviral defense and in virulence. The 73-residue N-terminal domain of NS1A (NS1A-(1-73)) forms a symmetric homodimer with a unique six-helical chain fold. It binds canonical A-form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Mutational inactivation of this dsRNA binding activity of NS1A highly attenuates virus replication. Here, we have characterized the unique structural features of the dsRNA binding surface of NS1A-(1-73) using NMR methods and describe the 2.1-A x-ray crystal structure of the corresponding dsRNA binding domain from human influenza B virus NS1B-(15-93). These results identify conserved dsRNA binding surfaces on both NS1A-(1-73) and NS1B-(15-93) that are very different from those indicated in earlier "working models" of the complex between dsRNA and NS1A-(1-73). The combined NMR and crystallographic data reveal highly conserved surface tracks of basic and hydrophilic residues that interact with dsRNA. These tracks are structurally complementary to the polyphosphate backbone conformation of A-form dsRNA and run at an approximately 45 degrees angle relative to the axes of helices alpha2/alpha2'. At the center of this dsRNA binding epitope, and common to NS1 proteins from influenza A and B viruses, is a deep pocket that includes both hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. This pocket provides a target on the surface of the NS1 protein that is potentially suitable for the development of antiviral drugs targeting both influenza A and B viruses.},

@article{Hale2010,
abstract = {Seasonal epidemics and periodic worldwide pandemics caused by influenza A viruses are of continuous concern. The viral nonstructural (NS1) protein is a multifunctional virulence factor that antagonizes several host innate immune defenses during infection. NS1 also directly stimulates class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, an essential cell survival pathway commonly mutated in human cancers. Here, we present a 2.3-A resolution crystal structure of the NS1 effector domain in complex with the inter-SH2 (coiled-coil) domain of p85beta, a regulatory subunit of PI3K. Our data emphasize the remarkable isoform specificity of this interaction, and provide insights into the mechanism by which NS1 activates the PI3K (p85beta:p110) holoenzyme. A model of the NS1:PI3K heterotrimeric complex reveals that NS1 uses the coiled-coil as a structural tether to sterically prevent normal inhibitory contacts between the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85beta and the p110 catalytic subunit. Furthermore, in this model, NS1 makes extensive contacts with the C2/kinase domains of p110, and a small acidic alpha-helix of NS1 sits adjacent to the highly basic activation loop of the enzyme. During infection, a recombinant influenza A virus expressing NS1 with charge-disruption mutations in this acidic alpha-helix is unable to stimulate the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate or the phosphorylation of Akt. Despite this, the charge-disruption mutations in NS1 do not affect its ability to interact with the p85beta inter-SH2 domain in vitro. Overall, these data suggest that both direct binding of NS1 to p85beta (resulting in repositioning of the N-terminal SH2 domain) and possible NS1:p110 contacts contribute to PI3K activation.},

abstract = {Protein synthesis initiation in reticulocyte lysates is inhibited by heme deficiency, low levels of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), or the purified kinase (HRI) that acts on the alpha polypeptide of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2alpha). The phosphoprotein profiles produced in lysates in response to these various conditions have been monitored directly in lysates after labeling for brief periods with pulses of [gamma-(32)P]ATP. The [(32)P]phosphoprotein profiles were analyzed by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide slab gels under conditions in which the HRI and eIF-2alpha polypeptides were clearly distinguished. All four modes of inhibition produced a rapid phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha compared to control lysates, which displayed little or no phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha. In heme-deficient lysates, phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha occurred rapidly both before and after the shut-off of protein synthesis; the delayed addition of hemin to these lysates resulted in a decrease in the phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha and the subsequent restoration of protein synthesis. These data suggest that rapid turnover of phosphate occurs at the site(s) of eIF-2alpha phosphorylation. In lysates inhibited by heme deficiency, GSSG, or added HRI, the phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha was accompanied by the rapid in situ phosphorylation of HRI. The inhibition of initiation induced by dsRNA was accompanied by the phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha and a 67,000-dalton polypeptide but not HRI. These observations in situ indicate that (i) the phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha is the critical event in these inhibitions of protein chain initiation, and (ii) the phosphorylation of HRI is associated with its activation in heme deficiency.},

abstract = {The double-stranded (ds) RNA-activated protein kinase from human cells is a 68 kd protein (p68 kinase) induced by interferon. On activation by dsRNA in the presence of ATP, the kinase becomes autophosphorylated and can catalyze the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eIF2, which leads to an inhibition of the initiation of protein synthesis. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of several related cDNAs from which can be deduced the full-length p68 kinase sequence. All of the cDNAs identify a 2.5 kb RNA that is strongly induced by interferon. The deduced amino acid sequence of the p68 kinase predicts a protein of 550 amino acids containing all of the conserved domains specific for members of the protein kinase family, including the catalytic domain characteristic of serine/threonine kinases. In vitro translation of a reconstructed full-length p68 kinase cDNA yields a protein of 68 kd that binds dsRNA, is recognized by a monoclonal antibody raised against the native p68 kinase, and is autophosphorylated.},

abstract = {All mRNAs of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) contain in their 5' untranslated region a sequence termed TAR that responds to trans-activation by the tat (trans-activating) protein. This RNA sequence assumes a stable secondary structure, and its cap structure is relatively inaccessible. Here we report that these structural properties of the TAR sequence underlie the ability of TAR to inhibit in trans the translation of other mRNAs. This mechanism of translation inhibition involves the activation of the double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase (dsl), which in turn phosphorylates the protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-2). Mutations in the TAR region that diminish the stability of the secondary structure cause a significant reduction in the trans-inhibition. A similar reduction in the dsl activation occurs when TAR is placed further downstream of the cap structure. This is a clear demonstration of a specific naturally occurring mRNA sequence that can activate dsl. We suggest a novel translational regulatory mechanism that interdigitates the activities of eIF-2 and eIF-4F.},

@article{Plotch1981,
abstract = {We propose a mechanism for the priming of influenza viral RNA transcription by capped RNAs in which specific 5'-terminal fragments are cleaved from the capped RNAs by a virion-associated endonuclease. These fragments would serve as the actual primers for the initiation of transcription by the initial incorporation by the initial incorporation of a G residue at their 3' end. We show that virions and purified viral cores contain a unique endonuclease that cleaves RNAs containing a 5' methylated cap structure (m7GpppXm) preferentially at purine residues 10 to 14 nucleotides from the cap, generating fragments with 3'-terminal hydroxyl groups. RNAs containing the 5'-terminal structure GpppG could not be cleaved to produce these specific fragments. Consistent with our proposed mechanism, those capped fragments that function as primers could be linked to a G residue in transcriptase reactions containing alpha-32P-GTP as the only ribonucleoside triphosphate. The pattern of G and C incorporation onto these primer fragments suggests that this incorporation is directed by the second and third bases at the 3' end of the virion RNA template, which has the sequence 3' UCG. Primer fragments with a 3'-terminal A residue were used more efficiently than those with a 3'-terminal G residue, indicating a preference for generating an AGC sequence in the viral mRNA complementary to the 3' end of the virion RNA. Cleavage of the RNA primer and initiation of transcription are not necessarily coupled, because a 5' fragment isolated from one reaction could be used as a primer when added to a second reaction. Uncapped ribopolymer inhibitors of viral RNA transcription inhibited the cleavage of capped RNAs.},

By screening more than 100 field isolates, it was found that the NS1 proteins had the greatest mobility differences, far exceeding those observed among other corresponding viral polypeptides. Partial sequence determination of RNA segment eight from 12 viruses revealed the existence of nonsense mutations at six different positions in their NS1 coding regions. The termination codons consisted of opal, ochre, and amber mutations. The sizes predicted from these sequences of 202, 217, 219, 220, 230, and 237 amino acids were in agreement with the observed mobilities of the viral polypeptides on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.

abstract = {The double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR is a critical mediator of the antiproliferative and antiviral effects exerted by interferons. Not only is PKR an effector molecule on the cellular response to double-stranded RNA, but it also integrates signals in response to Toll-like receptor activation, growth factors, and diverse cellular stresses. In this review, we provide a detailed picture on how signaling downstream of PKR unfolds and what are the ultimate consequences for the cell fate. PKR activation affects both transcription and translation. PKR phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 results in a blockade on translation initiation. However, PKR cannot avoid the translation of some cellular and viral mRNAs bearing special features in their 5' untranslated regions. In addition, PKR affects diverse transcriptional factors such as interferon regulatory factor 1, STATs, p53, activating transcription factor 3, and NF-kappaB. In particular, how PKR triggers a cascade of events involving IKK phosphorylation of IkappaB and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation has been intensively studied. At the cellular and organism levels PKR exerts antiproliferative effects, and it is a key antiviral agent. A point of convergence in both effects is that PKR activation results in apoptosis induction. The extent and strength of the antiviral action of PKR are clearly understood by the findings that unrelated viral proteins of animal viruses have evolved to inhibit PKR action by using diverse strategies. The case for the pathological consequences of the antiproliferative action of PKR is less understood, but therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting PKR are beginning to offer promising results.},

@article{Rubtsova2003,
abstract = {A relaxed cap-dependence of translation of the mRNA-encoding mammalian heat shock protein Hsp70 may suggest that its 5'-untranslated region (UTR) possesses an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In this study, this possibility has been tested in transfected cells using plasmids that express dicistronic mRNAs. Using a reporter gene construct, Renilla luciferase/Photinus pyralis luciferase, we show that the 216-nt long 5'-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA acts as an IRES that directs ribosomes to the downstream start codon by a cap-independent mechanism. The relative activity of this IRES (100-fold over the empty vector) is similar to that of the classical picornaviral IRESs. Additional controls indicate that this high expression of the downstream reporter is not due to readthrough from the upstream cistron, nor is it due to translation of cryptic monocistronic transcripts. The effect of small deletions within the 5'-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA on the IRES activity varies in dependence on their position within the 5'-UTR sequence. With the exception of deletion of nt 33-50, it is small for the 5'-terminal half of the 5'-UTR and rather strong for the 3'-terminal section. However, neither of these small deletions abolishes the IRES activity completely. Excision of larger sections (>50 nt) by truncation of the 5'-UTR from the 5'-end or by internal deleting results in a dramatic impairment of the IRES function. Taken together, these data suggest that the IRES activity of the 5'-UTR of Hsp70 mRNA requires integrity of almost the entire sequence of the 5'-UTR. The data are discussed in terms of a model that allows a three-dimensional rather than linear mode of selection of the initiation region surrounding the start codon of Hsp70 mRNA.},

Furthermore, by using SUMOylatable and non-SUMOylatable forms of NS1 and an NS1-specific artificial SUMO ligase (ASL) that increases NS1 SUMOylation approximately 4-fold, we demonstrate that SUMOylation does not affect the stability or cellular localization of PR8 NS1. However, NS1's ability to be SUMOylated appears to affect virus multiplication, as indicated by the delayed growth of a virus expressing the non-SUMOylatable form of NS1 in the interferon (IFN)-competent MDCK cell line. Remarkably, while a non-SUMOylatable form of NS1 exhibited a substantially diminished ability to neutralize IFN production, increasing NS1 SUMOylation beyond its normal levels also exerted a negative effect on its IFN-blocking function. This observation indicates the existence of an optimal level of NS1 SUMOylation that allows NS1 to achieve maximal activity and suggests that the limited amount of SUMOylation normally observed for most SUMO targets may correspond to an optimal level that maximizes the contribution of SUMOylation to protein function. Finally, protein cross-linking data suggest that SUMOylation may affect NS1 function by regulating the abundance of NS1 dimers and trimers in the cell.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that influenza A virus infection activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway by binding of influenza NS1 protein to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. Our previous study proposed that two polyproline motifs in NS1 (amino acids 164 to 167 [PXXP], SH3 binding motif 1, and amino acids 213 to 216 [PPXXP], SH3 binding motif 2) may mediate binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K. Here we performed individual mutational analyses on these two motifs and demonstrated that SH3 binding motif 1 contributes to the interactions of NS1 with p85beta, whereas SH3 binding motif 2 is not required for this process. Mutant viruses carrying NS1 with mutations in SH3 binding motif 1 failed to interact with p85beta and induce the subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. Mutant virus bearing mutations in SH3 binding motif 2 exhibited similar phenotype as the wild-type (WT) virus. Furthermore, viruses with mutations in SH3 binding motif 1 induced more severe apoptosis than did the WT virus. Our data suggest that SH3 binding motif 1 in NS1 protein is required for NS1-p85beta interaction and PI3K/Akt activation. Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway is beneficial for virus replication by inhibiting virus induced apoptosis through phosphorylation of caspase-9.},

In this perspective, we evaluate the possibility of integration of global omics-data in order to timely prepare for pandemics. Such an approach requires two major innovations. First, data that is obtained should be shared with the global community instantly. The strength of rapid integration of simple signals is exemplified by Google's(TM) Flu Trend, which could predict the incidence of influenza-like illness based on online search engine queries. Second, omics technologies need to be fast and high-throughput. We postulate that analysis of the exhaled breath would be a simple, rapid and non-invasive alternative. Breath contains hundreds of volatile organic compounds that are altered by infection and inflammation. The molecular fingerprint of breath (breathprint) can be obtained using an electronic nose, which relies on sensor technology. These breathprints can be stored in an online database (a "breathcloud") and coupled to clinical data. Comparison of the breathprint of a suspected subject to the breathcloud allows for a rapid decision on the presence or absence of a pathogen.},

abstract = {We previously demonstrated, by limited mutagenesis, that conserved sequence elements within the 5' end of influenza virus virion RNA (vRNA) are required for the polyadenylation of mRNA in vitro. To further characterize the nucleotide residues at the 5' end of vRNA which might be involved in polyadenylation, a complete set of short and long model vRNA-like templates with mutations at nucleotides 1' to 13' (prime notation denotes numbering from the 5' end) of vRNA were synthesized and transcribed in vitro. The products were assayed for mRNA production with both reverse transcription-PCR and [alpha-32P]ATP incorporation assays. Results from these independent assays showed that vRNA templates with point mutations at positions 2', 3', 7' to 9', and 11' to 13' synthesized polyadenylated transcripts inefficiently compared with those with mutations at positions 1', 4' to 6', and 10'. Positions 2', 3', 7' to 9', and 11' are known to be involved in RNA polymerase binding. Furthermore, residues at positions 11' to 13' are known to be involved in base pairing between the 3' and 5' ends of vRNA. These findings demonstrate that the RNA polymerase has to bind to the 5' end of the template vRNA, which must then interact with the 3' end of the same template for polyadenylation to occur. These results support a model in which a cis-acting RNA polymerase is required for the polyadenylation of influenza virus.},

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of commercially available pre-procedural mouthrinses containing 0.2 \% chlorhexidine gluconate, a herbal mouthwash and water in reducing the levels of viable bacteria in aerosols. Methods: This was a single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized, three-group parallel design and conducted over a period of 45 days. 24 patients with chronic periodontitis were divided randomly into three groups (A,B,C) of 8 patients each to be administered with 0.2 \% chlorhexidine gluconate, herbal mouthwash and water respectively, as a pre-procedural rinse. The aerosol produced by the ultrasonic unit was collected at patient's chest area, doctor's chest area and assistant's chest area on blood agar plates in all the three groups. The blood agar plates were incubated at 37o Celsius for 48 hours and the total number of colony- forming units (CFU) were counted and statistically analyzed. Results: The results showed that CFU in group A and group B were significantly reduced when compared to group C with P-value = 0.000 (ANOVA). Also, CFU in group A was significantly reduced when compared to group B with P-value < 0.05 (Independent t-test). The numbers of CFU were highest at patient's chest area and least on assistant's chest area. Conclusion: This study suggests that a routine pre-procedural mouthrinse could eliminate the majority of bacterial aerosols generated by the use of ultrasonic unit and 0.2\% chlorhexidine gluconate was more effective than herbal mouthwash.},

We previously reported that NS1 is able to inhibit the production of type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines in human primary dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we used recombinant viruses expressing mutant NS1 from the A/Texas/36/91 and A/Puerto Rico/08/34 strains in order to analyze the contribution of different NS1 domains to its antagonist functions. We show that the polyadenylation stimulating factor 30 (CPSF30) binding function of the NS1 protein from A/Texas/36/91 influenza virus, which is absent in the A/Puerto Rico/08/34 strain, is essential for counteracting these innate immune events in DCs. However, the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain, present in both strains, specifically inhibits the induction of type I IFN genes in infected DCs, while it is essential only for inhibition of type I IFN proteins and proinflammatory cytokine production in cells infected with influenza viruses lacking a functional CPSF30 binding domain, such as A/Puerto Rico/08/34.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1A protein) is a virulence factor which is targeted into the nucleus. It is a multifunctional protein that inhibits host cell pre-mRNA processing and counteracts host cell antiviral responses. We show that the NS1A protein can interact with all six human importin alpha isoforms, indicating that the nuclear translocation of NS1A protein is mediated by the classical importin alpha/beta pathway. The NS1A protein of the H1N1 (WSN/33) virus has only one N-terminal arginine- or lysine-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS1), whereas the NS1A protein of the H3N2 subtype (Udorn/72) virus also has a second C-terminal NLS (NLS2). NLS1 is mapped to residues 35 to 41, which also function in the double-stranded RNA-binding activity of the NS1A protein. NLS2 was created by a 7-amino-acid C-terminal extension (residues 231 to 237) that became prevalent among human influenza A virus types isolated between the years 1950 to 1987. NLS2 includes basic amino acids at positions 219, 220, 224, 229, 231, and 232. Surprisingly, NLS2 also forms a functional nucleolar localization signal NoLS, a function that was retained in H3N2 type virus NS1A proteins even without the C-terminal extension. It is likely that the evolutionarily well-conserved nucleolar targeting function of NS1A protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of influenza A virus.},

abstract = {The activation of the interferon (IFN) system, which is triggered largely by the recognition of viral nucleic acids, is one of the most important host defense reactions against viral infections. Although influenza A and B viruses, which both have segmented negative-strand RNA genomes, share major structural similarities, they have evolutionarily diverged, with total genetic incompatibility. Here we compare antiviral-inducing mechanisms during infections with type A and B influenza viruses in human dendritic cells. We observed that IFN responses are induced significantly faster in cells infected with influenza B virus than in cells infected with type A influenza virus and that the early induction of antiviral gene expression is mediated by the activation of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). We further demonstrate that influenza A virus infection activates IFN responses only after viral RNA (vRNA) synthesis, whereas influenza B virus induces IFN responses even if its infectivity is destroyed by UV treatment. Thus, initial viral transcription, replication, and viral protein synthesis are dispensable for influenza B virus-induced antiviral responses. Moreover, vRNA molecules from both type A and B viruses are equally potent activators of IFN induction, but incoming influenza B virus structures are recognized directly in the cytosol, while influenza A virus is able to evade early recognition. Collectively, our data provide new evidence of a novel antiviral evasion strategy for influenza A virus without a contribution of the viral NS1 protein, and this opens up new insights into different influenza virus pathogenicities.},

abstract = {The NS1 protein of influenza A virus binds not only to poly(A) and a stem-bulge region in U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), but also to double-stranded (ds) RNA. Binding assays with NS1 protein mutants established that the previously identified RNA-binding domain of the NS1 protein is required for binding to ds RNA as well as for binding to poly(A) and U6 snRNA. In addition, dsRNA competed with U6 snRNA for binding to the NS1 protein, consistent with both RNAs sharing the same binding site on the protein. As a consequence of its binding to dsRNA, the NS1 protein blocks the activation of the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) in vitro. This kinase phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (elF-2 alpha), leading to a decrease in the rate of initiation of translation. Assays using purified PKR and purified elF2 demonstrated that the NS1 protein blocks the dsRNA activation of PKR, and experiments using reticulocyte extracts showed that the NS1 protein blocks the inhibition of translation caused by dsRNA activation of PKR. The implications of these results for control mechanisms occurring in influenza virus-infected cells are discussed.},

abstract = {Some 20 years ago, the study of picornaviral RNA translation led to the characterization of an alternative mechanism of initiation by direct ribosome binding to the 5' UTR. By using a bicistronic vector, it was shown that the 5' UTR of the poliovirus (PV) or the Encephalomyelitis virus (EMCV) had the ability to bind the 43S preinitiation complex in a 5' and cap-independent manner. This is rendered possible by an RNA domain called IRES for Internal Ribosome Entry Site which enables efficient translation of an mRNA lacking a 5' cap structure. IRES elements have now been found in many different viral families where they often confer a selective advantage to allow ribosome recruitment under conditions where cap-dependent protein synthesis is severely repressed. In this review, we compare and contrast the structure and function of IRESes that are found within 4 distinct family of RNA positive stranded viruses which are the (i) Picornaviruses; (ii) Flaviviruses; (iii) Dicistroviruses; and (iv) Lentiviruses.},

Using optimized protocols, full length biologically active sPB1-F2 and a number of fragments have been synthesized by following either the standard elongation SPPS method or by native chemical ligation of unprotected N- and C-terminal peptide fragments at the histidine and cysteine residues located in position 41 and 42 of the native sequence, respectively. The ligation procedure afforded the most efficient synthesis of sPB1-F2 and facilitated the generation of various mutants of sPB1-F2 from pre-synthesized peptide fragments. During the synthesis of sPB1-F2, the formation of succinimide and subsequent conversion to the piperidine derivative at the aspartic acid residue in position 23 was observed. This reaction was forestalled by applying specific modifications to the SPPS protocol. The chain-elongation SPPS protocol is optimal for producing small peptides of sPB1-F2, their derivatives and precursors for a subsequent ligation protocol, while the full length protein, mutants and labelled derivatives are more conveniently and efficiently synthesized by SPPS protocols that include native chemical ligation. The molecular identity of sPB1-F2 was confirmed by peptide mapping, mass spectrometry, N-terminal sequencing, (1)H NMR spectroscopy and Western blot analysis. The latter analysis afforded direct evidence of the inherent tendency of sPB1-F2 to undergo oligomerization, a phenomenon observed both for full length sPB1-F2 and fragments thereof, as well as for its full length viral counterpart. Our synthesis protocols open the field for multiple biological and structural studies on sPB1-F2 that, similar to the molecule expressed in an IAV context, induces apoptosis and interacts with membranes in vitro and in vivo, as shown in previous studies.},

abstract = {The individual biological activities of many neurotrophic factors and their variants, which are produced by alternative splicing and proteolytic processing, often remain to be characterized. Bacterial protein production combined with protein refolding and purification is a conventional procedure to obtain active neurotrophic factors; however, the procedure is time consuming and appropriate protein refolding in vitro is sometimes unpredictable. Here we examined three distinct cell-free translation systems: reticulocyte lysate, Hela cell lysate and wheat germ extract, which may allow us to produce biologically active factors in a single tube. Taking type-I neuregulin-1 beta3 as an example, we produced neuregulin-1 protein from its mRNAs flanked by Cap nucleotide and/or internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and compared the yields and biological activity of translation products from these systems. The protein yield from IRES+ mRNA was highest in the Hela cell-free system, while background translation was lowest in the wheat germ system. The biological activity of both translation products was modest or negligible, however. Neuregulin-1 protein was produced in reticulocyte lysate at yields of 19 pmol/mL (\~{}500 ng/mL); furthermore, it was potent at phosphorylating ErbB4 receptor and able to bind to heparin sulfate. These results demonstrate that the reticulocyte lysate translation system produces active neurotrophic factors in vitro and is useful for radiolabeling or preliminary assessment of novel neurotrophic factors and their variants.},

abstract = {It has previously been shown that influenza virus NS1 protein enhances the translation of viral but not cellular mRNAs. This enhancement occurs by increasing the rate of translation initiation and requires the 5'UTR sequence, common to all viral mRNAs. In agreement with these findings, we show here that viral mRNAs, but not cellular mRNAs, are associated with NS1 during virus infection. We have previously reported that NS1 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF4GI, next to its poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1)-interacting domain and that NS1 and eIF4GI are associated in influenza virus-infected cells. Here we show that NS1, although capable of binding poly(A), does not compete with PABP1 for association with eIF4GI and, furthermore, that NS1 and PABP1 interact both in vivo and in vitro in an RNA-independent manner. The interaction maps between residues 365 and 535 in PABP1 and between residues 1 and 81 in NS1. These mapping studies, together with those previously reported for NS1-eIF4GI and PABP1-eIF4GI interactions, imply that the binding of all three proteins would be compatible. Collectively, these and previously published data suggest that NS1 interactions with eIF4GI and PABP1, as well as with viral mRNAs, could promote the specific recruitment of 43S complexes to the viral mRNAs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a virulence factor, which is targeted into the cell cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus. NS1 is a multi-functional protein that inhibits host cell pre-mRNA processing and counteracts host cell antiviral responses. Previously, we have shown that the NS1 protein of the H3N2 subtype influenza viruses possesses a C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) that also functions as a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) and targets the protein into the nucleolus. RESULTS: Here, we show that the NS1 protein of the human H3N2 virus subtype interacts in vitro primarily via its C-terminal NLS2/NoLS and to a minor extent via its N-terminal NLS1 with the nucleolar proteins, nucleolin and fibrillarin. Using chimeric green fluorescence protein (GFP)-NS1 fusion constructs, we show that the nucleolar retention of the NS1 protein is determined by its C-terminal NLS2/NoLS in vivo. Confocal laser microscopy analysis shows that the NS1 protein colocalizes with nucleolin in nucleoplasm and nucleolus and with B23 and fibrillarin in the nucleolus of influenza A/Udorn/72 virus-infected A549 cells. Since some viral proteins contain NoLSs, it is likely that viruses have evolved specific nucleolar functions. CONCLUSION: NS1 protein of the human H3N2 virus interacts primarily via the C-terminal NLS2/NoLS and to a minor extent via the N-terminal NLS1 with the main nucleolar proteins, nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin.},

abstract = {A short model genome RNA and also the genome RNA of influenza A virus bearing both 5'- and 3'-terminal common sequences activated the interferon-induced double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, by stimulating autophosphorylation in vitro. The activated PKR catalyzed phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eucaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). The NS1 protein efficiently eliminated the PKR-activating activity of these RNAs by binding to them. Two mutant NS1 proteins, each harboring a single amino acid substitution at different regions, exhibited temperature sensitivity in their RNA binding activity in the mutant virus-infected cell lysates as well as when they were prepared as fusion proteins expressed in bacteria. The virus strains carrying these mutant NS1 proteins exhibited temperature sensitivity in virus protein synthesis at the translational level, as reported previously, and could not repress the autophosphorylation of PKR developing during the virus growth, which is normally suppressed by a viral function(s). As a result, the level of eIF2alpha phosphorylation was elevated 2.5- to 3-fold. The defect in virus protein synthesis was well correlated with the level of phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2alpha.},

Elimination of toxic effects and a variety of options to stabilize the synthesized proteins enable the synthesis of otherwise difficult to obtain proteins. Modifications in the reaction design result in preparative scale production rates of cell-free reactions and yield in milligram amounts of membrane proteins per one millilitre of reaction volume. A diverse selection of detergents can be supplied into the reaction system without inhibitory effects to the translation machinery. This offers the unique opportunity to produce a membrane protein directly into micelles of a detergent of choice. We present detailed protocols for the cell-free production of membrane proteins in different modes and we summarize the current knowledge of this technique. A special emphasize will be on the production of soluble and functionally folded membrane proteins in presence of suitable detergents. In addition, we will highlight the advantages of cell-free expression for the structural analysis of membrane proteins especially by liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and we will discuss new strategies for structural approaches.},

One of our major goals is to determine how the NS1 protein recognizes and binds to its several RNA targets. As the first step for conducting structural studies, we have succeeded in identifying a fragment of the NS1 protein that possesses all the RNA-binding activities of the full-length protein. The RNA-binding fragment consists of the 73 amino-terminal amino acids of the protein. We have developed procedures for obtaining large amounts of the polypeptide in pure form. This has enabled us to establish the RNA-binding properties of this polypeptide and to demonstrate that it retains the ability to dimerize exhibited by the full-length protein. In addition, far-UV CD spectroscopy indicates that this RNA-binding polypeptide is largely (approximately 80\%) helical, suggesting that the mode of dimerization of the NS1 protein and of its interaction with RNA is mediated, at least in part, by helices.},

abstract = {Cell signaling in response to an array of diverse stress stimuli converges on the phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha on serine 51 results in a severe decline in de novo protein synthesis and is an important strategy in the cell's armory against stressful insults including viral infection, the accumulation of misfolded proteins, and starvation. The phosphorylation of eIF2alpha is carried out by a family of four kinases, PERK (PKR-like ER kinase), PKR (protein kinase double-stranded RNA-dependent), GCN2 (general control non-derepressible-2), and HRI (heme-regulated inhibitor). Each primarily responds to a distinct type of stress or stresses. Thus, while significant sequence similarity exists between the eIF2alpha kinases in their kinase domains, underlying their common role in phosphorylating eIF2alpha, additional unique features determine the regulation of these four proteins, that is, what signals activate them. This review will describe the structure of each eIF2alpha kinase and discuss how this is linked to their activation and function. In parallel to the general translational attenuation elicited by eIF2alpha kinase activation the translation of stress-induced mRNAs, most notably activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is enhanced and these set in motion cascades of gene expression constituting the integrated stress response (ISR), which seek to remediate stress and restore homeostasis. Depending on the cellular context and concurrent signaling pathways active, however, translational attenuation can also facilitate apoptosis. Accordingly, the role of the kinases in determining cell fate will also be discussed.},

Here, in an attempt to establish a mechanism for this activation, we report further on the functional interaction between NS1 and p85beta. Complex formation was found to be independent of NS1 RNA binding activity and is mediated by the C-terminal effector domain of NS1. Intriguingly, the primary direct binding site for NS1 on p85beta is the inter-SH2 domain, a coiled-coil structure that acts as a scaffold for the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K. In vitro kinase activity assays, together with protein binding competition studies, reveal that NS1 does not displace p110 from the inter-SH2 domain, and indicate that NS1 can form an active heterotrimeric complex with PI3K. In addition, it was established that residues at the C terminus of the inter-SH2 domain are essential for mediating the interaction between p85beta and NS1. Equivalent residues in p85alpha have previously been implicated in the basal inhibition of p110. However, such p85alpha residues were unable to substitute for those in p85beta with regards NS1 binding. Overall, these data suggest a model by which NS1 activates PI3K catalytic activity by masking a normal regulatory element specific to the p85beta inter-SH2 domain.},

Analysis of mutations of the loop length of the 22R sequence showed that the three-nucleotide loop (wild-type, 22R) induced much stronger GFP expression than did other loop lengths. Two mutations, 4TMI (A7-->T, A17-->T) and 5AMI (A6-->T, T18-->A), which caused the base type changes in the bulge and in the second stem in the 22R sequence, induced stronger GFP gene expression than 22R itself. Mutation of the bulge base (A17-->T), leading to complete complementation of the stem, caused weaker GFP gene expression. Sequences without a palindrome (7pieA, 5'-GTGAAAAAAATG CAAAAAAAGT-3', 7pieT, 5'-GTGTTTTTTTTGCTTTTTTTGT-3') did not activate GFP gene expression. We conclude that an imperfect palindrome affects and can increase GFP gene expression.},

Since the HCV 3'-UTR has a unique structure among 3'-UTRs, we checked possible communication between the 5'- and the 3'-UTR of HCV during translation using chimeric reporter RNAs. We show that translation directed by the HCV IRES and by the HCV-like IRES of porcine teschovirus (PTV) which belongs to a quite distinct family of viruses (picornaviruses) or by the EMCV IRES is also enhanced by the HCV 3'-UTR or by a poly(A)-tail in different cell types.},

abstract = {Hantaviruses, members of the Bunyaviridae family, are negative-stranded emerging RNA viruses and category A pathogens that cause serious illness when transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have evolved a novel translation initiation mechanism, operated by nucleocapsid protein (N), which preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNAs. N binds to the ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), a structural component of the 40 S ribosomal subunit. In addition, N also binds to both the viral mRNA 5' cap and a highly conserved triplet repeat sequence of the viral mRNA 5' UTR. The simultaneous binding of N at both the terminal cap and the 5' UTR favors ribosome loading on viral transcripts during translation initiation. We characterized the binding between N and RPS19 and demonstrate the role of the N-RPS19 interaction in N-mediated translation initiation mechanism. We show that N specifically binds to RPS19 with high affinity and a binding stoichiometry of 1:1. The N-RPS19 interaction is an enthalpy-driven process. RPS19 undergoes a conformational change after binding to N. Using T7 RNA polymerase, we synthesized the hantavirus S segment mRNA, which matches the transcript generated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in cells. We show that the N-RPS19 interaction plays a critical role in the translation of this mRNA both in cells and rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Our results demonstrate that the N-mediated translation initiation mechanism, which lures the host translation machinery for the preferential translation of viral transcripts, primarily depends on the N-RPS19 interaction. We suggest that the N-RPS19 interaction is a novel target to shut down the N-mediated translation strategy and hence virus replication in cells.},

abstract = {Viral infection is commonly associated with virus-driven hijacking of host proteins. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which influenza virus affects host cells through the interaction of influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) with the infected cell epigenome. We show that the NS1 protein of influenza A H3N2 subtype possesses a histone-like sequence (histone mimic) that is used by the virus to target the human PAF1 transcription elongation complex (hPAF1C). We demonstrate that binding of NS1 to hPAF1C depends on the NS1 histone mimic and results in suppression of hPAF1C-mediated transcriptional elongation. Furthermore, human PAF1 has a crucial role in the antiviral response. Loss of hPAF1C binding by NS1 attenuates influenza infection, whereas hPAF1C deficiency reduces antiviral gene expression and renders cells more susceptible to viruses. We propose that the histone mimic in NS1 enables the influenza virus to affect inducible gene expression selectively, thus contributing to suppression of the antiviral response.},

abstract = {The non-structural (NS1) protein of influenza A viruses is a non-essential virulence factor that has multiple accessory functions during viral infection. In recent years, the major role ascribed to NS1 has been its inhibition of host immune responses, especially the limitation of both interferon (IFN) production and the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins, such as dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) and 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L. However, it is clear that NS1 also acts directly to modulate other important aspects of the virus replication cycle, including viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and general host-cell physiology. Here, we review the current literature on this remarkably multifunctional viral protein. In the first part of this article, we summarize the basic biochemistry of NS1, in particular its synthesis, structure, and intracellular localization. We then discuss the various roles NS1 has in regulating viral replication mechanisms, host innate/adaptive immune responses, and cellular signalling pathways. We focus on the NS1-RNA and NS1-protein interactions that are fundamental to these processes, and highlight apparent strain-specific ways in which different NS1 proteins may act. In this regard, the contributions of certain NS1 functions to the pathogenicity of human and animal influenza A viruses are also discussed. Finally, we outline practical applications that future studies on NS1 may lead to, including the rational design and manufacture of influenza vaccines, the development of novel antiviral drugs, and the use of oncolytic influenza A viruses as potential anti-cancer agents.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic protein synthesis begins with mRNA positioning in the ribosomal decoding channel in a process typically controlled by translation-initiation factors. Some viruses use an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in their mRNA to harness ribosomes independently of initiation factors. We show here that a ribosome conformational change that is induced upon hepatitis C viral IRES binding is necessary but not sufficient for correct mRNA positioning. Using directed hydroxyl radical probing to monitor the assembly of IRES-containing translation-initiation complexes, we have defined a crucial step in which mRNA is stabilized upon initiator tRNA binding. Unexpectedly, however, this stabilization occurs independently of the AUG codon, underscoring the importance of initiation factor-mediated interactions that influence the configuration of the decoding channel. These results reveal how an IRES RNA supplants some, but not all, of the functions normally carried out by protein factors during initiation of protein synthesis.},

Here, it is reported that influenza A virus NS1 protein is responsible for PI3K/Akt pathway activation. It was demonstrated that the NS1 protein interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K via direct binding to the SH3 and C-terminal SH2 domains of p85. Consensus binding motifs for SH3 and SH2 domains were found in influenza A virus NS1, namely an SH2-binding motif (YXXXM) at aa 89, SH3-binding motif 1 (PXXP) around aa 164 and SH3-binding motif 2 around aa 212. Mutant virus encoding NS1 protein with mutations in the SH-binding motifs failed to interact with SH domains of p85 and did not activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. The mutant virus is attenuated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Our study has established a novel function of NS1: by interacting with p85 via the SH-binding motifs, NS1 can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway.},

abstract = {ISG15 is an IFN-alpha/beta-induced, ubiquitin-like protein that is conjugated to a wide array of cellular proteins through the sequential action of three conjugation enzymes that are also induced by IFN-alpha/beta. Recent studies showed that ISG15 and/or its conjugates play an important role in protecting cells from infection by several viruses, including influenza A virus. However, the mechanism by which ISG15 modification exerts antiviral activity has not been established. Here we extend the repertoire of ISG15 targets to a viral protein by demonstrating that the NS1 protein of influenza A virus (NS1A protein), an essential, multifunctional protein, is ISG15 modified in virus-infected cells. We demonstrate that the major ISG15 acceptor site in the NS1A protein in infected cells is a critical lysine residue (K41) in the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD). ISG15 modification of K41 disrupts the association of the NS1A RBD domain with importin-alpha, the protein that mediates nuclear import of the NS1A protein, whereas the RBD retains its double-stranded RNA-binding activity. Most significantly, we show that ISG15 modification of K41 inhibits influenza A virus replication and thus contributes to the antiviral action of IFN-beta. We also show that the NS1A protein directly and specifically binds to Herc5, the major E3 ligase for ISG15 conjugation in human cells. These results establish a "loss of function" mechanism for the antiviral activity of the IFN-induced ISG15 conjugation system, namely, that it inhibits viral replication by conjugating ISG15 to a specific viral protein, thereby inhibiting its function.},

abstract = {The virulence of influenza virus is a multigenic trait. One determinant of virulence is the multifunctional NS1 protein that functions in several ways to defeat the cellular innate immune response. Recent large-scale genome sequence analysis of avian influenza virus isolates indicated that four C-terminal residues of the NS1 protein is a PDZ ligand domain of the X-S/T-X-V type and it was speculated that it may represent a virulence determinant. To test this hypothesis, by using mice as a model system, the four C-terminal amino acid residues of a number of influenza virus strains were engineered into the A/WSN/33 virus NS1 protein by reverse genetics and the pathogenicity of the viruses determined. Viruses containing NS1 sequences from the 1918 H1N1 and H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses demonstrated increased virulence in infected mice compared with wt A/WSN/33 virus, as characterized by rapid loss of body weight, decreased survival time, and decreased mean lethal dose. Histopathological analysis of infected mouse lung tissues demonstrated severe alveolitis, hemorrhaging, and spread of the virus throughout the entire lung. The increase in pathogenicity was not caused by the overproduction of IFN, suggesting the NS1 protein C terminus may interact with PDZ-binding protein(s) and modulate pathogenicity through alternative mechanisms.},

abstract = {Avian influenza viruses belong to the genus influenza A virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. The influenza virus consists of eight segmented minus stranded RNA that encode 11 known proteins. Among the 11 viral proteins, NS1 (non-structural protein 1, encoded on segment 8) has been implicated in the regulation of several important intra-cellular functions. In this report, we investigated the functional interaction of NS1 with serine threonine kinase Akt, a core intra-cellular survival regulator. In co-immunoprecipitation assays and GST pull-down assays, NS1 directly interacted with Akt. The interaction was mediated primarily through the Akt-PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain and the RNA-binding domain of NS1. NS1 preferentially interacted with phosphorylated Akt, but not with non-phosphorylated Akt. Functionally, the NS1-Akt interaction enhanced Akt activity both in the intra-cellular context and in in vitro Akt kinase assays. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that phosphorylated Akt interacted with NS1 during the interphase of the cell cycle predominantly within the nucleus. Finally, mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated the position at Thr215 of NS1 protein is primary phosphorylation target site through Akt activation. The results together supported the functional importance of influenza virus NS1 with Akt, a core intra-cellular survival regulator.},

abstract = {The multi-functional NS1 protein of influenza A virus is a viral virulence determining factor. The last four residues at the C-terminus of NS1 constitute a type I PDZ domain binding motif (PBM). Avian influenza viruses currently in circulation carry an NS1 PBM with consensus sequence ESEV, whereas human influenza viruses bear an NS1 PBM with consensus sequence RSKV or RSEV. The PBM sequence of the influenza A virus NS1 is reported to contribute to high viral pathogenicity in animal studies. Here, we report the identification of PDlim2 as a novel binding target of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 strain with an NS1 PBM of ESEV (A/Chicken/Henan/12/2004/H5N1, HN12-NS1) by yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction was confirmed by in vitro GST pull-down assays, as well as by in vivo mammalian two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. The binding was also confirmed to be mediated by the interaction of the PDlim2 PDZ domain with the NS1 PBM motif. Interestingly, our assays showed that PDlim2 bound specifically with HN12-NS1, but exhibited no binding to NS1 from a human influenza H1N1 virus bearing an RSEV PBM (A/Puerto Rico/8/34/H1N1, PR8-NS1). A crystal structure of the PDlim2 PDZ domain fused with the C-terminal hexapeptide from HN12-NS1, together with GST pull-down assays on PDlim2 mutants, reveals that residues Arg16 and Lys31 of PDlim2 are critical for the binding between PDlim2 and HN12-NS1. The identification of a selective binding target of HN12-NS1 (ESEV), but not PR8-NS1 (RSEV), enables us to propose a structural mechanism for the interaction between NS1 PBM and PDlim2 or other PDZ-containing proteins.},

abstract = {The NS1 protein of influenza A virus (NS1A protein) is a multifunctional protein that counters cellular antiviral activities and is a virulence factor. Its N-terminal RNA-binding domain binds dsRNA. The only amino acid absolutely required for dsRNA binding is the R at position 38. To identify the role of this dsRNA-binding activity during influenza A virus infection, we generated a recombinant influenza A/Udorn/72 virus expressing an NS1A protein containing an RNA-binding domain in which R38 is mutated to A. This R38A mutant virus is highly attenuated, and the mutant NS1A protein, like the WT protein, is localized in the nucleus. Using the R38A mutant virus, we establish that dsRNA binding by the NS1A protein does not inhibit production of IFN-beta mRNA. Rather, we demonstrate that the primary role of this dsRNA-binding activity is to protect the virus against the antiviral state induced by IFN-beta. Pretreatment of A549 cells with IFN-beta for 6 h did not inhibit replication of WT Udorn virus, whereas replication of R38A mutant virus was inhibited 1,000-fold. Using both RNA interference in A549 cells and mouse knockout cells, we show that this enhanced sensitivity to IFN-beta-induced antiviral activity is due predominantly to the activation of RNase L. Because activation of RNase L is totally dependent on dsRNA activation of 2'-5' oligo (A) synthetase (OAS), it is likely that the primary role of dsRNA binding by the NS1A protein in virus-infected cells is to sequester dsRNA away from 2'-5' OAS.},

abstract = {Viruses are fully reliant on the translation machinery of their host cells to produce the polypeptides that are essential for viral replication. Consequently, viruses recruit host ribosomes to translate viral mRNAs, typically using virally encoded functions to seize control of cellular translation factors and the host signalling pathways that regulate their activity. This not only ensures that viral proteins will be produced, but also stifles innate host defences that are aimed at inhibiting the capacity of infected cells for protein synthesis. Remarkably, nearly every step of the translation process can be targeted by virally encoded functions. This Review discusses the diverse strategies that viruses use to subvert host protein synthesis functions and regulate mRNA translation in infected cells.},

abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

In intact reticulocytes treated with isonicotinic acid hydrazide to inhibit heme synthesis, the phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha was significantly greater than in control cells. In heme-deficient reticulocyte lysates and in lysates treated with double-stranded RNA, significant phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha occurred prior to the onset of inhibition of protein synthesis; a large proportion, however, of the total eIF-2 alpha remained unphosphorylated. These findings indicate that a modest concentration of phosphorylated eIF-2 alpha can suffice to inhibit initiation, and they suggest that one of the factors with which eIF-2 must interact may be rate limiting, especially when eIF-2 alpha is phosphorylated.},

A descendent of this lineage recently re-emerged in humans as the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Adaptation in pigs has led to several changes in the multifunctional viral NS1 protein as compared with the parental 1918 virus, most notably a K217E substitution that abolishes binding to host Crk/CrkL signalling adapters, and an 11 aa C-terminal truncation. Using reverse genetics, we reintroduced both these features into a prototype 2009 H1N1 strain, A/California/04/09. Restoration of Crk/CrkL binding or extension of NS1 to 230 aa had no impact on virus replication in human or swine cells. In addition, minimal effects on replication, pathogenicity and transmission were observed in mouse and ferret models. Our data suggest that the currently circulating 2009 H1N1 virus is optimized to replicate efficiently without requiring certain NS1 functions.},

Human lung epithelial cells were infected with either the highly pathogenic avian virus strain A/FPV/Bratislava/79 (H7N7) or the pandemic swine-origin influenza virus A/Hamburg/4/09 (H1N1v). The application of the JNK inhibitors SP600125 and AS601245 reduced IAV amplification by suppressing viral protein and RNA synthesis. Although AS601245 appeared to generally block the transcription of newly introduced genes, SP600125 specifically affected viral RNA synthesis. Overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of SEK/MKK4 and siRNA-mediated suppression of JNK2 expression confirmed that specific manipulation of the JNK pathway attenuates virus propagation. An IAV minigenome replication assay revealed that SP600125 did not directly affect the activity of the viral RNA polymerase complex but seems to suppress an anti-influenza nonstructural protein 1-mediated virus supportive function. Finally, when H7N7- or H1N1v-infected mice were treated with SP600125, the viral load is reduced in lungs of treated compared with untreated mice. Our data suggest that this class of ATP competitive inhibitors once optimized for antiviral action potentially represent novel drugs for antiviral intervention.},

abstract = {Efficient manipulation of the regulatory mechanisms controlling host cell gene expression provides the means for productive infection by animal viruses. Upon infecting the host cell, viruses must: (i) bypass the cellular antiviral defense mechanisms to prevent the translational blocks imposed by the interferon pathway; and (ii) effectively "hijack" the host protein synthetic machinery into mass production of virion protein components. The multicomponent regulatory nature of cellular gene expression has provided the means of selecting for a diverse range of mechanisms utilized by animal viruses to ensure that replication efficiency is maintained throughout the virus life cycle. One important research component of the careful examination of gene regulation is those studies that focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which viruses control mRNA translation during host cell infection. Much of the work in our laboratory has focused on elucidating the strategies by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and influenza virus regulate protein synthesis during infection. Here we describe the ways in which these two distinctly different RNA viruses ensure the selective and efficient translation of their viral mRNAs in infected cells. These strategies include circumvention of the deleterious effects associated with activation of the interferon-induced protein kinase, PKR. Herein we describe our methodologies designed to elucidate the translational regulation in cells infected by these viruses. We conclude with a brief summary of new directions, utilizing these methods, taken toward understanding the translational control mechanisms imposed by these viral systems, and how our studies of virally infected cells have allowed us to identify growth-regulating components of normal, uninfected cells.},

abstract = {The NS1 protein of influenza A virus contributes to viral pathogenesis, primarily by enabling the virus to disarm the host cell type IFN defense system. We examined the downstream effects of NS1 protein expression during influenza A virus infection on global cellular mRNA levels by measuring expression of over 13,000 cellular genes in response to infection with wild-type and mutant viruses in human lung epithelial cells. Influenza A/PR/8/34 virus infection resulted in a significant induction of genes involved in the IFN pathway. Deletion of the viral NS1 gene increased the number and magnitude of expression of cellular genes implicated in the IFN, NF-kappaB, and other antiviral pathways. Interestingly, different IFN-induced genes showed different sensitivities to NS1-mediated inhibition of their expression. A recombinant virus with a C-terminal deletion in its NS1 gene induced an intermediate cellular mRNA expression pattern between wild-type and NS1 knockout viruses. Most significantly, a virus containing the 1918 pandemic NS1 gene was more efficient at blocking the expression of IFN-regulated genes than its parental influenza A/WSN/33 virus. Taken together, our results suggest that the cellular response to influenza A virus infection in human lung cells is significantly influenced by the sequence of the NS1 gene, demonstrating the importance of the NS1 protein in regulating the host cell response triggered by virus infection.},

abstract = {Expression of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) in virus-infected vertebrate cells is a key event in the establishment of a sustained antiviral response, which is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced during viral replication. These antiviral cytokines initiate the expression of cellular proteins with activities that limit the replication and spread of the invading viruses. Within this response, the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) that is expressed at constitutive levels and upregulated by IFN-alpha/beta acts as an important antiviral effector that can block the cellular translational machinery. We previously demonstrated that efficient replication of influenza B virus depends on the viral dsRNA-binding NS1 protein that inhibits the transcriptional activation of IFN-alpha/beta genes. Here we tested the postulate that the viral NS1 protein counteracts antiviral responses through sequestering intracellular dsRNA by analyzing a collection of recombinant influenza B viruses. As expected, viruses expressing dsRNA-binding-defective NS1 proteins were strongly attenuated for replication in IFN-competent hosts. Interestingly, these virus mutants failed to prevent activation of PKR but could effectively limit IFN induction. Conversely, a mutant virus expressing the N-terminal dsRNA-binding domain of NS1 prevented PKR activation, but not IFN induction, suggesting an important role for the NS1 C-terminal part in silencing the activation route of IFN-alpha/beta genes. Thus, our findings indicate an unexpected mechanistic dichotomy of the influenza B virus NS1 protein in the suppression of antiviral responses, which involves at least one activity that is largely separable from dsRNA binding.},

abstract = {To understand the regulation of cap-dependent translation initiation mediated by specific 5' untranslated region (UTR) RNA-protein interactions in mammalian cells, we have studied the selective translation of influenza virus mRNAs. Previous work has shown that the host cell mRNA binding protein guanine-rich sequence factor 1 (GRSF-1) bound specifically to conserved viral 5' UTR sequences and stimulated translation of viral 5' UTR-driven mRNAs in vitro. In the present study, we have characterized the functional domains of GRSF-1 and mapped the RNA binding activity of GRSF-1 to RRM 2 (amino acids 194 to 275) with amino-terminal deletion glutathione S-transferase (GST)-GRSF-1 proteins. When these mutants were assayed for functional activity in vitro, deletion of an Ala-rich region (Delta[2-94]) appeared to diminish translational stimulation, while deletion of the Ala-rich region in addition to RRM 1 (Delta[2-194]) resulted in a 4-fold increase in translational activation over wild-type GRSF-1 (an overall 20-fold increase in activity). We have also mapped the GRSF-1 RNA binding site on influenza virus NP and NS1 5' UTRs, which was determined to be the sequence AGGGU. With polysome fractionation and cDNA microarray analysis, we have identified cellular and viral mRNAs containing putative GRSF-1 binding sites that were transcriptionally up-regulated and selectively recruited to polyribosomes following influenza virus infection. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that RRM 2 is critical for GRSF-1 RNA binding and translational activity. Further, our data suggest GRSF-1 functions by selectively recruiting cellular and viral mRNAs containing 5' UTR GRSF-1 binding sites to polyribosomes, which is mediated through interactions with cellular proteins.},

CpBV encodes CpBV15alpha, which was previously shown to interfere with host protein translation. In vivo transient expression of CpBV15alpha induced a significant decrease in a storage protein level without its transcriptional level change. In vitro translation assay using rabbit reticulocyte lysate showed that CpBV15alpha suppressed translation efficiency of mRNAs extracted from fat body of P. xylostella. Transient expression of CpBV15alpha in nonparasitized P. xylostella suppressed humoral immunity and development to pupal and adult stages. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of CpBV15alpha co-precipitated eIF2 and eIF2B (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor of eIF2) in parasitized P. xylostella. Additionally, IP of eIF2 co-precipitated CpBV15alpha as well as eIF2B and eIF5 in parasitized larvae. IP with eIF5 antibody showed that relative amount of eIF2 bound to eIF5 was much decreased in parasitized larvae, while significant amount of eIF2 was bound to CpBV15alpha. These results suggest that CpBV15alpha inhibits some host mRNA translation by sequestering eIF2.},

The capacity of these mutants to bind RNA was studied by in vitro binding tests using a model vRNA probe. These experiments showed that the N-terminal 81 amino acids of NS1 protein are sufficient for RNA binding activity. The collection of mutants also served to map the NS1 sequences required for nuclear retention of mRNA and for stimulation of viral mRNA translation, using the NP gene as reporter. The results obtained indicated that the N-terminal 113 amino acids of NS1 protein are sufficient for nuclear retention of mRNA and stimulation of viral mRNA translation.

abstract = {The heterotrimeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza viruses catalyzes RNA replication and transcription activities in infected cell nuclei. The nucleotide polymerization activity is common to both replication and transcription processes, with an additional cap-snatching function being employed during transcription to steal short 5'-capped RNA primers from host mRNAs. Cap-binding, endonuclease, and polymerase activities have long been studied biochemically, but structural studies on the polymerase and its subunits have been hindered by difficulties in producing sufficient quantities of material. Recently, because of heightened effort and advances in expression and crystallization technologies, a series of high resolution structures of individual domains have been determined. These shed light on intrinsic activities of the polymerase, including cap snatching, subunit association, and nucleocytoplasmic transport, and open up the possibility of structure-guided development of new polymerase inhibitors. Furthermore, the activity of influenza polymerase is highly host- and cell type-specific, being dependent on the identity of a few key amino acid positions in the different subunits, especially in the C-terminal region of PB2. New structures demonstrate the surface exposure of these residues, consistent with ideas that they might modulate interactions with host-specific factors that enhance or restrict activity. Recent proteomic and genome-wide interactome and RNA interference screens have suggested the identities of some of these potential regulators of polymerase function.},

In intact reticulocytes treated with isonicotinic acid hydrazide to inhibit heme synthesis, the phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha was significantly greater than in control cells. In heme-deficient reticulocyte lysates and in lysates treated with double-stranded RNA, significant phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha occurred prior to the onset of inhibition of protein synthesis; a large proportion, however, of the total eIF-2 alpha remained unphosphorylated. These findings indicate that a modest concentration of phosphorylated eIF-2 alpha can suffice to inhibit initiation, and they suggest that one of the factors with which eIF-2 must interact may be rate limiting, especially when eIF-2 alpha is phosphorylated.},

Functionally, ICP11 prevented DNA from binding to histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H2A.x, and in hemocytes from WSSV-infected shrimp, ICP11 colocalized with histone H3 and activated-H2A.x. These observations together suggest that ICP11 might interfere with nucleosome assembly and prevent H2A.x from fulfilling its critical function of repairing DNA double strand breaks. Therefore, ICP11 possesses a functionality that is unique among the handful of presently known DNA mimic proteins.},

abstract = {Most viruses express one or several proteins that counter the anti-viral defences of the host-cell. This is the task of non-structural protein NS1 in influenza viruses. Absent from the viral particle but highly expressed in the infected cell, NS1 dramatically inhibits the cellular gene expression and prevents the activation of key players in the interferon system. In addition, NS1 selectively enhances the translation of viral mRNAs and may regulate the synthesis of viral RNAs. Our knowledge of the virus and of its protein NS1 has dramatically increased during the last fifteen years. The atomic structure of NS1 has been determined, many cellular partners were identified and its multiple activities have been studied in depth. This review presents our current knowledge and attempts to establish relationships between the RNA sequence, the structure of the protein, its ligands, its activities and the pathogenicity of the virus. A better knowledge of NS1 could help in elaborating novel antiviral strategies, based on either live vaccines with altered NS1, or on small-compounds inhibitors of NS1.},

abstract = {The effect of NS1 protein on the efficiency of influenza virus mRNA translation was evaluated by determining the accumulation of nucleoprotein (NP) or M1 mRNAs in the cytoplasm of cells expressing either of these genes alone or in combination with the NS1 gene, as well as the total cell accumulation of NP or M1 protein. Coexpression of NS1, but not of NS2 protein, led to increases in the translation of these mRNAs in the range of 5- to 100-fold. This translation enhancement was specific for viral mRNAs, since the translation of neither cat nor lacZ mRNAs was affected by the coexpression of NS1 protein. The use of chimeric cat genes containing the 5'-extracistronic sequences of the influenza virus mRNAs corresponding to segment 2, 7, or 8 indicated that these sequences can in part account for the observed effect. The enhancement of viral mRNA translation mediated by NS1 protein was due to an increase in the translation initiation rate, since the sizes of NP-specific polysomes, but not those of lacZ-specific polysomes, was significantly higher in cells coexpressing NS1 protein than in those expressing only the NP gene.},

abstract = {The non-structural protein 1 of influenza virus (NS1) is a relatively small polypeptide with an outstanding number of ascribed functions. NS1 is the main viral antagonist of the innate immune response during influenza virus infection, chiefly by inhibiting the type I interferon system at multiple steps. As such, its role is critical to overcome the first barrier the host presents to halt the viral infection. However, the pro-viral activities of this well-studied protein go far beyond and include regulation of viral RNA and protein synthesis, and disruption of the host cell homeostasis by dramatically affecting general gene expression while tweaking the PI3K signaling network. Because of all of this, NS1 is a key virulence factor that impacts influenza pathogenesis, and adaptation to new hosts, making it an attractive target for control strategies. Here, we will overview the many roles that have been ascribed to the NS1 protein, and give insights into the sequence features and structural properties that make them possible, highlighting the need to understand how NS1 can actually perform all of these functions during viral infection.},

abstract = {Selective translation of influenza viral mRNAs occurs after influenza virus superinfection of cells infected with the VAI RNA-negative adenovirus mutant dl331 (M. G. Katze, Y.-T. Chen, and R. M. Krug, Cell 37:483-490, 1984). Cell extracts from these doubly infected cells catalyze the initiation of essentially only influenza viral protein synthesis, reproducing the in vivo situation. This selective translation is correlated with a 5- to 10-fold suppression of the dl331-induced kinase that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eucaryotic initiation factor eIF-2. This strongly suggests that influenza virus encodes a gene product that, analogous to the adenoviral VAI RNA, prevents the shutdown of overall protein synthesis caused by an eIF-2 alpha kinase turned on by viral infection. Adenoviral mRNA translation was restored to the extract from the doubly infected cells by the addition of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF-2B, which is responsible for the normal recycling of eIF-2 during protein synthesis. This indicates that the residual kinase in the doubly infected cells leads to a limitation in functional (nonsequestered) eIF-2B and hence functional (GTP-containing) eIF-2 and that under these conditions influenza viral mRNAs are selectively translated over adenoviral mRNAs. Addition of double-stranded RNA to the extracts from these cells restored the eIF-2 alpha kinase to a level approaching that seen in extracts from cells infected with dl331 alone and caused the inhibition of influenza viral mRNA translation. This suggests that the putative influenza viral gene product acts against the double-stranded RNA activation of the kinase and indicates that influenza viral mRNA translation is also linked to the level of functional eIF-2. Our results thus indicate that a limitation in functional eIF-2 which causes a nonspecific reduction in the rate of initiation of protein synthesis results in the preferential translation of the better mRNAs (influenza viral mRNAs) at the expense of the poorer mRNAs (adenoviral mRNAs).},

Pharmaceutical proteins are usually expressed in cell based systems in the development phase and in production, and although cell free methods have recently emerged they have not been used widely for therapeutic protein development or production. Cell free expression methodology is well suited for pharmaceutical protein expression and engineering and will probably become more commonly used in the future. Cell free expression allows protein engineering in high throughput format, flexible strategies for glycosylation and chemical conjugation, and allows easy use of unnatural amino acids as building blocks of proteins. Thus, cell free expression can be used to modify protein solubility, stability, and pharmacokinetics of therapeutic proteins. Likewise, it is potentially useful in protein development for biomaterial matrices, nanoparticles, and vaccines. This review illustrates the potential of cell free expression in pharmaceutical protein research and development while highlighting both advantages and limitations of the method.},

@article{Park1999,
abstract = {To better understand regulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis, we studied cellular and viral mRNA translation in influenza virus-infected cells. Influenza virus infection results in a dramatic shut-off of cellular protein synthesis that is concomitant with selective viral mRNA translation. Earlier work showed that these events are mediated by viral and/or cellular factors binding to the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of viral mRNAs. To identify trans-acting cellular proteins responsible for selective viral protein synthesis, we employed the yeast three-hybrid system. Using the 5' UTR of the influenza virus nucleocapsid protein (NP) mRNA as bait, we identified the cellular RNA-recognition motif containing RNA-binding protein G-rich sequence factor 1 (GRSF-1) as a positive-acting translational regulatory factor. The in vivo yeast assay revealed GRSF-1 specifically bound to the NP 5' UTR but not select NP 5' UTR mutants or cellular RNA 5' UTRs. These data were confirmed by gel shift assays using recombinant GRSF-1. Importantly, recombinant GRSF-1 specifically stimulated translation of a NP 5' UTR-driven template in cell-free translation systems. Furthermore, translation efficiency of NP 5' UTR-driven templates was reduced markedly in GRSF-1-depleted HeLa cell extracts, but restored in GRSF-1-reconstituted extracts. GRSF-1 also stimulated translation of an NP 5' UTR-driven template in HeLa cell extracts that were depleted of essential factors by addition of RNA oligonucleotides representing the viral 5' UTR RNA. Taken together, these data document the functional demonstration of a cellular protein binding to influenza virus RNAs and, importantly, suggest that influenza virus may recruit GRSF-1 to the 5' UTR to ensure preferential translation of viral mRNAs in infected cells.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus NS1 protein, a virus-encoded alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) antagonist, appears to be a key regulator of protein expression in infected cells. We now show that NS1 protein expression results in enhancement of reporter gene activity from transfected plasmids. This effect appears to be mediated at the translational level, and it is reminiscent of the activity of the adenoviral virus-associated I (VAI) RNA, a known inhibitor of the antiviral, IFN-induced, PKR protein. To study the effects of the NS1 protein on viral and cellular protein synthesis during influenza A virus infection, we used recombinant influenza viruses lacking the NS1 gene (delNS1) or expressing truncated NS1 proteins. Our results demonstrate that the NS1 protein is required for efficient viral protein synthesis in COS-7 cells. This activity maps to the amino-terminal domain of the NS1 protein, since cells infected with wild-type virus or with a mutant virus expressing a truncated NS1 protein-lacking approximately half of its carboxy-terminal end-showed similar kinetics of viral and cellular protein expression. Interestingly, no major differences in host cell protein synthesis shutoff or in viral protein expression were found among NS1 mutant viruses in Vero cells. Thus, another viral component(s) different from the NS1 protein is responsible for the inhibition of host protein synthesis during viral infection. In contrast to the earlier proposal suggesting that the NS1 protein regulates the levels of spliced M2 mRNA, no effects on M2 protein accumulation were seen in Vero cells infected with delNS1 virus.},

We investigated the safety and immunogenicity of a trivalent formulation containing influenza H1N1, H3N2 and B strains lacking NS1 (delNS1-trivalent). METHODS: Healthy adult study participants who were seronegative for at least one strain present in the vaccine formulation were randomized to receive a single intranasal dose of delNS1-trivalent vaccine at 7.0log10 TCID50/subject (n=39) or placebo (n=41). RESULTS: Intranasal vaccination with the live replication-deficient delNS1-trivalent vaccine was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events. The most common adverse events identified, i.e. headache, oropharyngeal pain and rhinitis-like symptoms, were mainly mild and transient and distributed similarly in the treatment and placebo groups. Significant vaccine-specific immune responses were induced. Pre-existing low antibody titers or seronegativity for the corresponding vaccine strain yielded better response rates. CONCLUSIONS: We show that vaccination with a replication-deficient trivalent influenza vaccine containing H1N1, H3N2 and B strains lacking NS1 is safe and induces significant levels of antibodies (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01369862).},

abstract = {The DeltaF508 mutation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a trafficking mutant, which is retained and degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The mutant protein fails to reach a completely folded conformation that is no longer a substrate for ubiquitination ("stable B"). Wild type protein reaches this state with 25\% efficiency. In this study the rabbit reticulocyte lysate with added microsomal membranes has been used to reproduce the post-translational events in the folding of wild type and DeltaF508 CFTR. In this system wild type CFTR does not reach the stable B form if the post-translational temperature is 37 degrees C, whereas at 30 degrees C the behavior of both wild type and mutant proteins mimics that observed in the cell. Geldanamycin stabilizes DeltaF508 CFTR with respect to ubiquitination only when added post-translationally. The interaction of wild type and mutant CFTR with the molecular chaperones heat shock cognate 70 (hsc70) and heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) has been assessed. Release of wild type protein from hsc70 coincides with the cessation of ubiquitination and formation of stable B. Geldanamycin immediately prevents the binding of hsp90 to DeltaF508 CFTR, and after a delay releases it from hsc70. Release of mutant protein from hsc70 also coincides with the formation of stable B DeltaF508 CFTR.},

A descendent of this lineage recently re-emerged in humans as the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Adaptation in pigs has led to several changes in the multifunctional viral NS1 protein as compared with the parental 1918 virus, most notably a K217E substitution that abolishes binding to host Crk/CrkL signalling adapters, and an 11 aa C-terminal truncation. Using reverse genetics, we reintroduced both these features into a prototype 2009 H1N1 strain, A/California/04/09. Restoration of Crk/CrkL binding or extension of NS1 to 230 aa had no impact on virus replication in human or swine cells. In addition, minimal effects on replication, pathogenicity and transmission were observed in mouse and ferret models. Our data suggest that the currently circulating 2009 H1N1 virus is optimized to replicate efficiently without requiring certain NS1 functions.},

abstract = {The Influenza A virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional virulence factor with several protein-protein interaction domains, involved in preventing apoptosis of the infected cell and in evading the interferon response. In addition, the majority of influenza A virus NS1 proteins have a class I PDZ-binding motif at the C-terminus, and this itself has been shown to be a virulence determinant.In the majority of human influenza NS1 proteins the consensus motif is RSxV: in avian NS1 it is ESxV. Of the few human strains that have the avian motif, all were from very high mortality outbreaks of the disease. Previous work has shown that minor differences in PDZ-binding motifs can have major effects on the spectrum of cellular proteins targeted. In this study we analyse the effect of these differences upon the binding of Influenza A virus NS1 protein to a range of cellular proteins involved in polarity and signal transduction.},

abstract = {Currently, little is known about the viral kinetics of influenza A during infection within an individual. We utilize a series of mathematical models of increasing complexity, which incorporate target cell limitation and the innate interferon response, to examine influenza A virus kinetics in the upper respiratory tracts of experimentally infected adults. The models were fit to data from an experimental H1N1 influenza A/Hong Kong/123/77 infection and suggest that it is important to include the eclipse phase of the viral life cycle in viral dynamic models. Doing so, we estimate that after a delay of approximately 6 h, infected cells begin producing influenza virus and continue to do so for approximately 5 h. The average lifetime of infected cells is approximately 11 h, and the half-life of free infectious virus is approximately 3 h. We calculated the basic reproductive number, R(0), which indicated that a single infected cell could produce approximately 22 new productive infections. This suggests that antiviral treatments have a large hurdle to overcome in moderating symptoms and limiting infectiousness and that treatment has to be initiated as early as possible. For about 50\% of patients, the curve of viral titer versus time has two peaks. This bimodal behavior can be explained by incorporating the antiviral effects of interferon into the model. Our model also compared well to an additional data set on viral titer after experimental infection and treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, which suggests that such models may prove useful in estimating the efficacies of different antiviral therapies for influenza A infection.},

abstract = {Influenza virus NS1 protein is an RNA-binding protein whose expression alters several posttranscriptional regulatory processes, like polyadenylation, splicing, and nucleocytoplasmic transport of cellular mRNAs. In addition, NS1 protein enhances the translational rate of viral, but not cellular, mRNAs. To characterize this effect, we looked for targets of NS1 influenza virus protein among cellular translation factors. We found that NS1 coimmunoprecipitates with eukaryotic initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI), the large subunit of the cap-binding complex eIF4F, either in influenza virus-infected cells or in cells transfected with NS1 cDNA. Affinity chromatography studies using a purified His-NS1 protein-containing matrix showed that the fusion protein pulls down endogenous eIF4GI from COS-1 cells and labeled eIF4GI translated in vitro, but not the eIF4E subunit of the eIF4F factor. Similar in vitro binding experiments with eIF4GI deletion mutants indicated that the NS1-binding domain of eIF4GI is located between residues 157 and 550, in a region where no other component of the translational machinery is known to interact. Moreover, using overlay assays and pull-down experiments, we showed that NS1 and eIF4GI proteins interact directly, in an RNA-independent manner. Mapping of the eIF4GI-binding domain in the NS1 protein indicated that the first 113 N-terminal amino acids of the protein, but not the first 81, are sufficient to bind eIF4GI. The first of these mutants has been previously shown to act as a translational enhancer, while the second is defective in this activity. Collectively, these and previously published data suggest a model where NS1 recruits eIF4GI specifically to the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of the viral mRNA, allowing for the preferential translation of the influenza virus messengers.},

abstract = {Enhancement of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) translation initiation by the 3' poly(A) tail is mediated through interaction of poly(A)-binding protein with eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G, bridging the 5' terminal cap structure. In contrast to cellular mRNA, translation of the uncapped, non-polyadenylated hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome occurs independently of eIF4G and a role for 3'-untranslated sequences in modifying HCV gene expression is controversial. Utilizing cell-based and in vitro translation assays, we show that the HCV 3'-untranslated region (UTR) or a 3' poly(A) tract of sufficient length interchangeably stimulate translation dependent upon the HCV internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). However, in contrast to cap-dependent translation, the rate of initiation at the HCV IRES was unaffected by 3'-untranslated sequences. Analysis of post-initiation events revealed that the 3' poly(A) tract and HCV 3'-UTR improve translation efficiency by enabling termination and possibly ribosome recycling for successive rounds of translation.},

abstract = {NS1 of influenza A virus is a potent antagonist of host antiviral interferon responses. This multifunctional protein with two distinctive domains, an RNA-binding domain (RBD) and an effector domain (ED) separated by a linker region (LR), is implicated in replication, pathogenesis, and host range. Although the structures of individual domains of NS1 from different strains of influenza viruses have been reported, the only structure of full-length NS1 available to date is from an H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004). By carrying out crystallographic analyses of full-length H6N6-NS1 (A/blue-winged teal/MN/993/1980) and an LR deletion mutant, combined with mutational analysis, we show here that these full-length NS1 structures provide an exquisite structural sampling of various conformational states of NS1 that based on the orientation of the ED with respect to RBD can be summarized as "open," "semi-open," and "closed" conformations. Our studies show that preference for these states is clearly dictated by determinants such as linker length, residue composition at position 71, and a mechanical hinge, providing a structural basis for strain-dependent functional variations in NS1. Because of the flexibility inherent in the LR, any particular NS1 could sample the conformational space around these states to engage ED in different quaternary interactions so that it may participate in specific protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions to allow for the known multifunctionality of NS1. We propose that such conformational plasticity provides a mechanism for autoregulating NS1 functions, depending on its temporal distribution, posttranslational modifications, and nuclear or cellular localization, during the course of virus infection. IMPORTANCE: NS1 of influenza A virus is a multifunctional protein associated with numerous strain-specific regulatory functions during viral infection, including conferring resistance to antiviral interferon induction, replication, pathogenesis, virulence, and host range. NS1 has two domains, an RNA-binding domain and an effector domain separated by a linker. To date, the only full-length NS1 structure available is that from an H5N1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004). Here, we determined crystal structures of the wild type and a linker region mutant of the H6N6 NS1 (A/blue-winged teal/MN/993/1980), which together with the previously determined H5N1 NS1 structure show that NS1 exhibits significant strain-dependent structural polymorphism due to variations in linker length, residue composition at position 71, and a mechanical hinge. Such a structural polymorphism may be the basis for strain-specific functions associated with NS1.},

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of commercially available pre-procedural mouthrinses containing 0.2 \% chlorhexidine gluconate, a herbal mouthwash and water in reducing the levels of viable bacteria in aerosols. Methods: This was a single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized, three-group parallel design and conducted over a period of 45 days. 24 patients with chronic periodontitis were divided randomly into three groups (A,B,C) of 8 patients each to be administered with 0.2 \% chlorhexidine gluconate, herbal mouthwash and water respectively, as a pre-procedural rinse. The aerosol produced by the ultrasonic unit was collected at patient's chest area, doctor's chest area and assistant's chest area on blood agar plates in all the three groups. The blood agar plates were incubated at 37o Celsius for 48 hours and the total number of colony- forming units (CFU) were counted and statistically analyzed. Results: The results showed that CFU in group A and group B were significantly reduced when compared to group C with P-value = 0.000 (ANOVA). Also, CFU in group A was significantly reduced when compared to group B with P-value < 0.05 (Independent t-test). The numbers of CFU were highest at patient's chest area and least on assistant's chest area. Conclusion: This study suggests that a routine pre-procedural mouthrinse could eliminate the majority of bacterial aerosols generated by the use of ultrasonic unit and 0.2\% chlorhexidine gluconate was more effective than herbal mouthwash.},

@article{Smyth2005,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Spotted arrays are often printed with probes in duplicate or triplicate, but current methods for assessing differential expression are not able to make full use of the resulting information. The usual practice is to average the duplicate or triplicate results for each probe before assessing differential expression. This results in the loss of valuable information about genewise variability. RESULTS: A method is proposed for extracting more information from within-array replicate spots in microarray experiments by estimating the strength of the correlation between them. The method involves fitting separate linear models to the expression data for each gene but with a common value for the between-replicate correlation. The method greatly improves the precision with which the genewise variances are estimated and thereby improves inference methods designed to identify differentially expressed genes. The method may be combined with empirical Bayes methods for moderating the genewise variances between genes. The method is validated using data from a microarray experiment involving calibration and ratio control spots in conjunction with spiked-in RNA. Comparing results for calibration and ratio control spots shows that the common correlation method results in substantially better discrimination of differentially expressed genes from those which are not. The spike-in experiment also confirms that the results may be further improved by empirical Bayes smoothing of the variances when the sample size is small. AVAILABILITY: The methodology is implemented in the limma software package for R, available from the CRAN repository http://www.r-project.org},

abstract = {Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15, which is robustly induced by IFN or virus, is implicated to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) in vivo. But the underlying mechanism still remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that Herc5 could catalyze conjugation of ISG15 onto IAV-NS1 protein, the critical virulence factor of IAV. This modification produces two more species, respectively mapped to IAV-NS1 at lysine 20, 41, 217, 219, and 108, 110, and 126. The ISGylated IAV-NS1 fails to form homodimers and inhibits relevant antiviral processes. Knockdown of Herc5 or ISG15 could partially alleviate IFN-beta-induced antiviral activities against IAV, whereas ectopic expression of the Herc5-mediated ISGylation system could distinctly potentiate IFN-beta-induced antiviral effects against IAV. Notably, IAV-NS1s of H5N1 avian IAVs display less ISGylation species than that of IAV-PR8/34 (human H1N1). Consistently, IAV-PR8/34 mutants deprived of IAV-NS1's ISGylation exhibit augmented viral propagation and virulence in both cultured cells and mice. Our study reports the first microbial target of ISGylation and uncovers the direct antiviral function and mechanism of this novel modification.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that phosphorylation of the NS1 protein of a human influenza A virus occurs not only at the threonine (T) at position 215 but also at serines (Ss), specifically at positions 42 and 48. By generating recombinant influenza A/Udorn/72 (Ud) viruses that encode mutant NS1 proteins, we determined the roles of these phosphorylations in virus replication. At position 215 only a T-to-A substitution attenuated replication, whereas other substitutions (T to E to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, T to N, and T to P, the amino acid in avian influenza A virus NS1 proteins) had no effect. We conclude that attenuation resulting from the T-to-A substitution at position 215 is attributable to a deleterious structural change in the NS1 protein that is not caused by other amino acid substitutions and that phosphorylation of T215 does not affect virus replication. At position 48 neither an S-to-A substitution nor an S-to-D substitution that mimics constitutive phosphorylation affected virus replication. In contrast, at position 42, an S-to-D, but not an S-to-A, substitution caused attenuation. The S-to-D substitution eliminates detectable double-stranded RNA binding by the NS1 protein, accounting for attenuation of virus replication. We show that protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha) catalyzes S42 phosphorylation. Consequently, the only phosphorylation of the NS1 protein of this human influenza A virus that regulates its replication is S42 phosphorylation catalyzed by PKCalpha. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ts or Ss in the NS1 protein of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus was not detected, indicating that NS1 phosphorylation probably does not play any role in the replication of this virus.},

Their roles in transport and cellular communication, furthermore, often make over-expression toxic to their host, and their hydrophobicity and structural complexity make isolation and reconstitution a complicated task, especially in cases where proteins are targeted to inclusion bodies. The development of cell-free expression systems provides a very interesting alternative to cell-based systems, since it circumvents many problems such as toxicity or necessity for the transportation of the synthesized protein to the membrane, and constitutes the only system that allows for direct production of membrane proteins in membrane-mimetic environments which may be suitable for liquid state NMR measurements. The unique advantages of the cell-free expression system, including strong expression yields as well as the direct incorporation of almost any combination of amino acids with very little metabolic scrambling, has allowed for the development of a wide-array of isotope labelling techniques which facilitate structural investigations of proteins whose spectral congestion and broad line-widths may have earlier rendered them beyond the scope of NMR. Here we explore various labelling strategies in conjunction with cell-free developments, with a particular focus on alpha-helical transmembrane proteins which benefit most from such methods.},

abstract = {The NS1 protein of classical swine H1N1 influenza A virus evolved dynamically during the past 80 years, most notable changes happened in the four C-terminal sequences and the C-terminal truncation of 11 amino acids. However, the role of these changes on the virulence of classical swine H1N1 influenza A virus remains unknown. Using reverse genetics, three NS1 mutant viruses (RSEV, GSEI, and EPEV) and a wild-type virus (PEQK) were generated from A/Swine/Shanghai/1/2005 virus and the pathogenicity of the viruses was determined in mice. The results showed that RSEV and PEQK viruses could not infect the mice. By contrast, GSEI and EPEV viruses could replicate in the lungs of mice without prior adaptation. The viral titers in lungs from GSEI and EPEV virus-infected mice were 2,300 and 7 pfu/g at fourth-day post-infection, respectively. Mild-to-moderate alveolitis was observed in the histopathological test of lungs from GSEI and EPEV virus-infected mice. The results indicated that C-terminal GSEI and EPEV motifs of NS1 protein involved in viral virulence and facilitated the A/Swine/Shanghai/1/2005 virus crossing the species barrier from swine to mice.},

abstract = {Primary differentiated respiratory epithelial cell cultures closely model the in vivo environment and allow for studies of innate immune responses generated specifically by epithelial cells, the primary cell type infected by human influenza A virus strains. We used primary murine tracheal epithelial cell (mTEC) cultures to investigate antiviral and cytokine responses to influenza A virus infection, focusing on the contribution of the RNA binding domain of the NS1 protein. rWSN NS1 R38A replication is attenuated in mTEC cultures; however, viral antigen is detected predominantly in ciliated cells, similar to wild-type virus. NS1 and NS1 R38A proteins display a primarily cytoplasmic localization in infected mTEC cultures. Increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and beta interferon is observed during rWSN NS1 R38A infection, and cytokines are secreted in a directional manner. Cytokine pretreatment of mTEC cultures and Vero cells suggest that rWSN NS1 R38A is more sensitive to the presence of antiviral/inflammatory cytokines than wild-type virus. Our results demonstrate that the RNA binding domain is a critical regulator of both cytokine production and cytokine sensitivity during influenza A virus infection of primary tracheal epithelial cells.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic protein synthesis begins with mRNA positioning in the ribosomal decoding channel in a process typically controlled by translation-initiation factors. Some viruses use an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in their mRNA to harness ribosomes independently of initiation factors. We show here that a ribosome conformational change that is induced upon hepatitis C viral IRES binding is necessary but not sufficient for correct mRNA positioning. Using directed hydroxyl radical probing to monitor the assembly of IRES-containing translation-initiation complexes, we have defined a crucial step in which mRNA is stabilized upon initiator tRNA binding. Unexpectedly, however, this stabilization occurs independently of the AUG codon, underscoring the importance of initiation factor-mediated interactions that influence the configuration of the decoding channel. These results reveal how an IRES RNA supplants some, but not all, of the functions normally carried out by protein factors during initiation of protein synthesis.},

abstract = {The interferon (IFN)-induced protein kinase (PKR) functions as a gatekeeper of mRNA translation initiation and is, therefore, a key mediator of the host IFN-induced antiviral defense system. Many viruses have invested countermeasures against PKR. Some apparently use more than one mechanism. The influenza virus can repress PKR activity through the use of at least two factors, the cellular P58IPK protein and the viral NS1 protein. The exact mode of action of the latter has not been established. Here, using a coprecipitation assay, we found that PKR could form a complex with NS1 in crude cell extracts prepared from influenza virus-infected HeLa cells. The NS1-PKR interaction was verified by using the yeast two-hybrid system and an in vitro binding assay. Deletion analysis mapped the NS1 binding site to the N-terminal 98 residues of PKR regulatory region. Furthermore, an NS1 mutant, which lacks PKR inhibitory activity, did not bind PKR. Finally, the functional role of NS1 in PKR inhibition was substantiated using an in vivo assay for PKR activity. These results support the role of NS1 in PKR modulation during viral infection that is mediated through a complex formation between the two proteins.},

Predicting DNA binding sites and affinities from transcription factor sequence or structure is difficult; therefore, experimental data are required to link transcription factors to target sequences. We present a microfluidics-based approach for de novo discovery and quantitative biophysical characterization of DNA target sequences. We validated our technique by measuring sequence preferences for 28 Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factors with a variety of DNA-binding domains, including several that have proven difficult to study by other techniques. For each transcription factor, we measured relative binding affinities to oligonucleotides covering all possible 8-bp DNA sequences to create a comprehensive map of sequence preferences; for four transcription factors, we also determined absolute affinities. We expect that these data and future use of this technique will provide information essential for understanding transcription factor specificity, improving identification of regulatory sites and reconstructing regulatory interactions.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus RNA synthesis is catalyzed by the viral polymerase comprised of the PA, PB1, and PB2 proteins. We show that the host DDX21 RNA helicase restricts influenza A virus by binding PB1 and inhibiting polymerase assembly, resulting in reduced viral RNA and protein synthesis. Later during infection, the viral NS1 protein overcomes this restriction by binding to DDX21 and displacing PB1. DDX21 binds to a region of the NS1 N-terminal domain that also participates in other critical functions. A virus mutant whose NS1 protein is unable to bind DDX21 exhibits reduced viral protein synthesis at both late and early times of infection, a phenotype converted to wild-type upon DDX21 knockdown. As sequential interaction of PB1 and NS1 with DDX21 leads to temporal regulation of viral gene expression, influenza A virus likely uses the DDX21-NS1 interaction not only to overcome restriction, but also to regulate the viral life cycle.},

abstract = {Incubation of reticulocyte lysates or isolated crude ribosomes with low levels of double-stranded RNA (0.1-10 ng/ml) induces the formation of an inhibitor of protein synthesis initiation similar to that observed in heme deficiency. The inhibitor is associated with a cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activity (ATP:protein phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.37) that phosphorylates the small polypeptide (38,000 daltons) of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2. Activation of the inhibitor requires ATP in addition to double-stranded RNA and is accompanied by the phosphorylation of a 67,000-dalton polypeptide of unknown function. The inhibitor remains associated with the ribosomes during high-speed sedimentation. Once formed, the ribosome-associated inhibitor phosphorylates eIF-2 and inhibits protein synthesis in the absence of double-stranded RNA. Inhibition is prevented by exogenous eIF-2. The bound inhibitor can be solubilized by extraction with 0.5 M KCl. The soluble inhibitor preparation retains the ability to phosphorylate the small polypeptide of eIF-2 and to inhibit protein synthesis. Untreated crude ribosomes also contain cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activities that phosphorylate the middle polypeptide (49,000 daltons) of eIF-2 and several polypeptide subunits of eIF-3 (160,000, 125,000, and 65,000 daltons); these kinase activities are not affected by double-stranded RNA and do not inhibit protein synthesis.},

abstract = {Avian influenza viruses belong to the genus influenza A virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. The influenza virus consists of eight segmented minus stranded RNA that encode 11 known proteins. Among the 11 viral proteins, NS1 (non-structural protein 1, encoded on segment 8) has been implicated in the regulation of several important intra-cellular functions. In this report, we investigated the functional interaction of NS1 with serine threonine kinase Akt, a core intra-cellular survival regulator. In co-immunoprecipitation assays and GST pull-down assays, NS1 directly interacted with Akt. The interaction was mediated primarily through the Akt-PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain and the RNA-binding domain of NS1. NS1 preferentially interacted with phosphorylated Akt, but not with non-phosphorylated Akt. Functionally, the NS1-Akt interaction enhanced Akt activity both in the intra-cellular context and in in vitro Akt kinase assays. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that phosphorylated Akt interacted with NS1 during the interphase of the cell cycle predominantly within the nucleus. Finally, mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated the position at Thr215 of NS1 protein is primary phosphorylation target site through Akt activation. The results together supported the functional importance of influenza virus NS1 with Akt, a core intra-cellular survival regulator.},

Here, we show that at non-cytotoxic concentrations, these small molecules accelerate the deaths of non-cancerous cells infected with influenza A virus (IAV) or other viruses. In particular, we demonstrate that ABT-263 altered Bcl-xL interactions with Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (Bad), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats protein (UACA). ABT-263 thereby activated the caspase-9-mediated mitochondria-initiated apoptosis pathway, which, together with the IAV-initiated caspase-8-mediated apoptosis pathway, triggered the deaths of IAV-infected cells. Our results also indicate that Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense virus constituents to regulate cellular apoptosis. Importantly, premature killing of IAV-infected cells by ABT-263 attenuated the production of key pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines. The imbalance in cytokine production was also observed in ABT-263-treated IAV-infected mice, which resulted in an inability of the immune system to clear the virus and eventually lowered the survival rates of infected animals. Thus, the results suggest that the chemical inhibition of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w could potentially be hazardous for cancer patients with viral infections.},

abstract = {Pneumonia occurring as a secondary infection after influenza is a major cause of excess morbidity and mortality, despite the availability and use of antibiotics active against Streptococcus pneumoniae. We hypothesized that the use of a bacteriostatic protein synthesis inhibitor would improve outcomes by reducing the inflammatory response. BALB/cJ mice infected with influenza virus and superinfected with S. pneumoniae were treated with either the cell-wall-active antibiotic ampicillin or the protein synthesis inhibitor clindamycin or azithromycin. In the model, ampicillin therapy performed significantly worse (survival rate, 56\%) than (1) clindamycin therapy used either alone (82\%) or in combination with ampicillin (80\%) and (2) azithromycin (92\%). Improved survival appeared to be mediated by decreased inflammation manifested as lower levels of inflammatory cells and proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs and by observation of less-severe histopathologic findings. These data suggest that beta-lactam therapy may not be optimal as a first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia when it follows influenza.},

We show that the direct binding of PKR to the NS1 protein in vitro that results in inhibition of PKR activation requires the NS1 123-127 amino acid sequence. To establish whether such direct binding of PKR to the NS1 protein is responsible for inhibiting PKR activation in infected cells, we generated recombinant influenza A/Udorn/72 viruses expressing NS1 proteins in which amino acids 123/124 or 126/127 are changed to alanines. In cells infected with these mutant viruses, PKR is activated, eIF-2alpha is phosphorylated and viral protein synthesis is inhibited, indicating that direct binding of PKR to the 123-127 sequence of the NS1 protein is necessary and sufficient to block PKR activation in influenza A virus-infected cells. Unexpectedly, the 123/124 mutant virus is not attenuated because reduced viral protein synthesis is offset by enhanced viral RNA synthesis at very early times of infection. These early viral RNAs include those synthesized predominantly at later times during wild-type virus infection, demonstrating that wild-type temporal regulation of viral RNA synthesis is absent in 123/124 virus-infected cells. Enhanced early viral RNA synthesis after 123/124 virus infection also occurs in mouse PKR-/- cells, demonstrating that PKR activation and deregulation of the time course of viral RNA synthesis are not coupled. These results indicate that the 123/124 site of the NS1A protein most likely functionally interacts with the viral polymerase to mediate temporal regulation of viral RNA synthesis. This interaction would occur in the nucleus, whereas PKR would bind to NS1A proteins in the cytoplasm prior to their import into the nucleus.},

abstract = {The RNA-binding/dimerization domain of the NS1 protein of influenza A virus (73 amino acids in length) exhibits a novel dimeric six-helical fold. It is not known how this domain binds to its specific RNA targets, one of which is double-stranded RNA. To elucidate the mode of RNA binding, we introduced single alanine replacements into the NS1 RNA-binding domain at specific positions in the three-dimensional structure. Our results indicate that the dimer structure is essential for RNA binding, because any alanine replacement that causes disruption of the dimer also leads to the loss of RNA-binding activity. Surprisingly, the arginine side chain at position 38, which is in the second helix of each monomer, is the only amino-acid side chain that is absolutely required only for RNA binding and not for dimerization, indicating that this side chain probably interacts directly with the RNA target. This interaction is primarily electrostatic, because replacement of this arginine with lysine had no effect on RNA binding. A second basic amino acid, the lysine at position 41, which is also in helix 2, makes a strong contribution to the affinity of binding. We conclude that helix 2 and helix 2', which are antiparallel and next to each other in the dimer conformation, constitute the interaction face between the NS1 RNA-binding domain and its RNA targets, and that the arginine side chain at position 38 and possibly the lysine side chain at position 41 in each of these antiparallel helices contact the phosphate backbone of the RNA target.},

abstract = {We have developed an eight-plasmid DNA transfection system for the rescue of infectious influenza A virus from cloned cDNA. In this plasmid-based expression system, viral cDNA is inserted between the RNA polymerase I (pol I) promoter and terminator sequences. This entire pol I transcription unit is flanked by an RNA polymerase II (pol II) promoter and a polyadenylation site. The orientation of the two transcription units allows the synthesis of negative-sense viral RNA and positive-sense mRNA from one viral cDNA template. This pol I-pol II system starts with the initiation of transcription of the two cellular RNA polymerase enzymes from their own promoters, presumably in different compartments of the nucleus. The interaction of all molecules derived from the cellular and viral transcription and translation machinery results in the generation of infectious influenza A virus. The utility of this system is proved by the recovery of the two influenza A viruses: A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Teal/HK/W312/97 (H6N1). Seventy-two hours after the transfection of eight expression plasmids into cocultured 293T and MDCK cells, the virus yield in the supernatant of the transfected cells was between 2 x 10(5) and 2 x 10(7) infectious viruses per milliliter. We also used this eight-plasmid system for the generation of single and quadruple reassortant viruses between A/Teal/HK/W312/97 (H6N1) and A/WSN/33 (H1N1). Because the pol I-pol II system facilitates the design and recovery of both recombinant and reassortant influenza A viruses, it may also be applicable to the recovery of other RNA viruses entirely from cloned cDNA.},

abstract = {The amino acid selenocysteine is encoded by UGA, usually a stop codon, thus requiring a specialized machinery to enable its incorporation into selenoproteins. The machinery comprises the tRNA(Sec), a 3'-UTR mRNA stem-loop termed SElenoCysteine Insertion Sequence (SECIS), which is mandatory for recoding UGA as a Sec codon, the SECIS Binding Protein 2 (SBP2), and other proteins. Little is known about the molecular mechanism and, in particular, when, where, and how the SECIS and SBP2 contact the ribosome. Previous work by others used the isolated SECIS RNA to address this question. Here, we developed a novel approach using instead engineered minimal selenoprotein mRNAs containing SECIS elements derivatized with photoreactive groups. By cross-linking experiments in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, new information could be gained about the SBP2 and SECIS contacts with components of the translation machinery at various translation steps. In particular, we found that SBP2 was bound only to the SECIS in 48S pre-initiation and 80S pretranslocation complexes. In the complex where the Sec-tRNA(Sec) was accommodated to the A site but transpeptidation was blocked, SBP2 bound the ribosome and possibly the SECIS element as well, and the SECIS had flexible contacts with the 60S ribosomal subunit involving several ribosomal proteins. Altogether, our findings led to broadening our understanding about the unique mechanism of selenocysteine incorporation in mammals.},

abstract = {The 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus encodes an NS1 protein with 11 amino acids (aa) truncation at the C-terminus. The C-terminal tail of influenza virus NS1 protein constitutes a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) and is the binding domain of the cellular pre-mRNA processing protein, poly(A)-binding protein II (PABII). Here, our studies showed that the C-terminal-truncated NS1 of the 2009 pandemic virus was inefficient at blocking host gene expression, extension of the truncated NS1 to its full length increased the inhibition of host gene expression. Mechanistically, this increased inhibition of host gene expression by the full-length NS1 was not associated with nucleolar localization, but was due to the restoration of NS1's binding capacity to PABII. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo characterization of two recombinant viruses encoding either the C-terminal 11-aa truncated or full-length NS1 of the 2009 pandemic virus showed that the C-terminal 11-aa truncation in NS1 did not significantly alter virus replication, but increased virus pathogenicity in mice.},

abstract = {The RIG-I like receptor pathway is stimulated during RNA virus infection by interaction between cytosolic RIG-I and viral RNA structures that contain short hairpin dsRNA and 5' triphosphate (5'ppp) terminal structure. In the present study, an RNA agonist of RIG-I was synthesized in vitro and shown to stimulate RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses at concentrations in the picomolar range. In human lung epithelial A549 cells, 5'pppRNA specifically stimulated multiple parameters of the innate antiviral response, including IRF3, IRF7 and STAT1 activation, and induction of inflammatory and interferon stimulated genes - hallmarks of a fully functional antiviral response. Evaluation of the magnitude and duration of gene expression by transcriptional profiling identified a robust, sustained and diversified antiviral and inflammatory response characterized by enhanced pathogen recognition and interferon (IFN) signaling. Bioinformatics analysis further identified a transcriptional signature uniquely induced by 5'pppRNA, and not by IFNalpha-2b, that included a constellation of IRF7 and NF-kB target genes capable of mobilizing multiple arms of the innate and adaptive immune response. Treatment of primary PBMCs or lung epithelial A549 cells with 5'pppRNA provided significant protection against a spectrum of RNA and DNA viruses. In C57Bl/6 mice, intravenous administration of 5'pppRNA protected animals from a lethal challenge with H1N1 Influenza, reduced virus titers in mouse lungs and protected animals from virus-induced pneumonia. Strikingly, the RIG-I-specific transcriptional response afforded partial protection from influenza challenge, even in the absence of type I interferon signaling. This systems approach provides transcriptional, biochemical, and in vivo analysis of the antiviral efficacy of 5'pppRNA and highlights the therapeutic potential associated with the use of RIG-I agonists as broad spectrum antiviral agents.},

abstract = {Because influenza viral RNA transcription in vitro is greatly enhanced by the addition of a primer dinucleotide, ApG or GpG, we have proposed that viral RNA transcription in vivo requires initiation by primer RNAs synthesized by the host cell, specifically by RNA polymerase II, thereby explaining the alpha-amanitin sensitivity of viral RNA transcription in vivo. Here, we identify such primer RNAs, initially in reticulocyte extracts, where they are shown to be globin mRNAs. Purified globin mRNAs very effectively stimulated viral RNA transcription in vitro, and the resulting transcripts directed the synthesis of all the nonglycosylated virus-specific proteins in micrococcal nuclease-treated L cell extracts. The viral RNA transcripts synthesized in vitro primed by ApG also directed the synthesis of the nonglycosylated virus-specific proteins, but the globin mRNA-primed transcripts were translated about 3 times more efficiently. The translation of the globin mRNA-primed, but not the ApG-primed, viral RNA transcripts was inhibited by 7-methylguanosine 5'-phosphate in the presence of S-adenosylhomocysteine, suggesting that the globin mRNA-primed transcripts contained a 5'-terminal methylated cap structure. We propose that this cap was transferred from the globin mRNA primer to the newly synthesized viral RNA transcripts, because no detectable de novo synthesis of a methylated cap occurred during globin mRNA-primed viral RNA transcription. Preliminary experiments indicate that other purified eukaryotic mRNAs also stimulate influenza viral RNA transcription in vitro.},

abstract = {Appropriate RNAs are transcribed and amplified and proteins are expressed after transfection into cells of in vitro-reconstituted RNA-protein complexes and infection with influenza virus as the helper. This system permits us to study the signals involved in transcription of influenza virus RNAs. For the analysis we used a plasmid-derived RNA containing the reporter gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) flanked by the noncoding sequences of the NS RNA segment of influenza A/WSN/33 virus. Mutations were then introduced into both the 5' and 3' ends, and the resulting RNAs were studied to determine their transcription in vitro and their CAT expression activity in the RNA-protein transfection system. The results reveal that a stretch of uninterrupted uridines at the 5' end of the negative-strand RNA is essential for mRNA synthesis. Also, a double-stranded RNA "panhandle" structure generated by the 5'- and 3'-terminal nucleotides appears to be required for polyadenylation, since opening up of these base pairs diminished mRNA synthesis and eliminated expression of CAT activity by the mutant RNAs. Finally, it was shown that this double-stranded RNA structural requirement is not sequence specific, since a synthetic GC clamp can replace the virus-coded RNA duplex. The data suggest that the viral RNA polymerase adds poly(A) by a slippage (stuttering) mechanism which occurs when it hits the double-stranded RNA barrier next to the stretch of uridines.},

Out of 38 tested protein constructs, 37 express at levels suitable for structural biology, i.e. enough to produce several milligrams of protein routinely and without excessive costs.

abstract = {A major component of the cellular antiviral system is the latent protein kinase PKR, which is activated by binding to either double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or the cellular PACT protein. Activated PKR phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2, thereby inhibiting viral and cellular protein synthesis and virus replication. To evade the antiviral effects of PKR, many viruses, including influenza A virus, have evolved multiple mechanisms. For influenza A virus, the non-structural (NS1A) protein plays a major role in blocking activation of PKR during virus infection. The mechanism by which the NS1A protein inhibits PKR activation in infected cells has not been established. In the present study, we first carried out a series of in vitro experiments to determine whether the NS1A protein could utilize a common mechanism to inhibit PKR activation by both PACT and dsRNA, despite their different modes of activation. We demonstrated that the direct binding of the NS1A protein to the N-terminal 230 amino acid region of PKR can serve as such a common mechanism and that this binding does not require the RNA-binding activity of the NS1A protein. The lack of requirement for NS1A RNA-binding activity for the inhibition of PKR activation in vivo was established by two approaches. First, we showed that an NS1A protein lacking RNA-binding activity, like the wild-type (wt) protein, blocked PKR activation by PACT in vivo, as well as the downstream effects of PKR activation in cells, namely, eIF2 phosphorylation and apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrated that PKR activation is inhibited in cells infected with a recombinant influenza A virus expressing NS1A mutant protein that cannot bind RNA, as is the case in cells infected with wild-type influenza A virus.},

abstract = {Influenza A NS1 and NS2 proteins are encoded by the RNA segment 8 of the viral genome. NS1 is a multifunctional protein and a virulence factor while NS2 is involved in nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes. A yeast two-hybrid screening strategy was used to identify host factors supporting NS1 and NS2 functions. More than 560 interactions between 79 cellular proteins and NS1 and NS2 proteins from 9 different influenza virus strains have been identified. These interacting proteins are potentially involved in each step of the infectious process and their contribution to viral replication was tested by RNA interference. Validation of the relevance of these host cell proteins for the viral replication cycle revealed that 7 of the 79 NS1 and/or NS2-interacting proteins positively or negatively controlled virus replication. One of the main factors targeted by NS1 of all virus strains was double-stranded RNA binding domain protein family. In particular, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) appeared as a pro-viral host factor whose expression is necessary for optimal viral protein synthesis and replication. Surprisingly, ADAR1 also appeared as a pro-viral host factor for dengue virus replication and directly interacted with the viral NS3 protein. ADAR1 editing activity was enhanced by both viruses through dengue virus NS3 and influenza virus NS1 proteins, suggesting a similar virus-host co-evolution.},

abstract = {Translation directed by the poliovirus (PV) or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is very inefficient when expressed from Sindbis virus (SV) replicons. This inhibition can be rescued by co-expression of PV 2A protease (2A(pro)). Inhibition correlates with the extensive phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2alpha induced by SV replication. Confirmation that PV or EMCV IRES-driven translation can function when eIF2alpha is not phosphorylated was obtained in dsRNA-activated protein kinase knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PKR(-/-) MEFs), where SV replication cannot induce eIF2alpha phosphorylation, and in variant S51A MEFs that express an unphosphorylatable eIF2alpha. In these cells, PV or EMCV IRES-dependent translation operated more efficiently than in wild-type MEFs. However, this translation was potently blocked when eIF2alpha was phosphorylated by the addition of thapsigargin to PKR(-/-) MEFs. In addition, when wild-type eIF2alpha was expressed in S51A MEFs or PKR was expressed in PKR(-/-) MEFs, PV IRES-dependent translation decreased. In both cases, the decrease in PV IRES-dependent translation correlated with the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Notably, PV 2A(pro) expression rescued PV IRES-driven translation in thapsigargin-treated PKR(-/-) MEFs. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PV IRES-driven translation can take place from SV replicons if eIF2alpha remains unphosphorylated. Remarkably, PV IRES-dependent translation was fully functional in this system when PV 2A(pro) was present, even if eIF2alpha was phosphorylated.},

To identify the sequence in NS2 mRNA that is recognized by the NS1 protein, we developed a gel shift assay for the formation of specific RNA-protein complexes. With this assay, it was established that the NS1 protein binds to the poly(A) sequence at the 3' end of NS2 mRNA and of other mRNAs. In addition, the NS1 protein was shown to bind to poly(A) itself. This specificity was also observed in vivo. The NS1 protein inhibited the nuclear export of every poly(A)-containing mRNA that was tested. In contrast, the NS1 protein failed to inhibit the nuclear export of an mRNA whose 3' end was generated by cleavage without subsequent addition of poly(A). Addition of poly(A) to this mRNA enabled the NS1 protein to inhibit mRNA export. The implications of these results for the role of the NS1 protein during virus infection are discussed.},

abstract = {The apparent de novo formation of viral membranes within cytoplasmic factories is a mysterious, poorly understood first step in poxvirus morphogenesis. Genetic studies identified several viral proteins essential for membrane formation and the assembly of immature virus particles. Their repression results in abortive replication with the accumulation of dense masses of viroplasm. In the present study, we further characterized one of these proteins, A11, and investigated its association with cellular and viral membranes under normal and abortive replication conditions. We discovered that A11 colocalized in cytoplasmic factories with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and L2, another viral protein required for morphogenesis. Confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation indicated that A11 was not membrane associated in uninfected cells, whereas L2 still colocalized with the ER. Cell-free transcription and translation experiments indicated that both A11 and L2 are tail-anchored proteins that associate posttranslationally with membranes and likely require specific cytoplasmic targeting chaperones. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that A11, like L2, associated with crescent membranes and immature virions during normal infection and with vesicles and tubules near masses of dense viroplasm during abortive infection in the absence of the A17 or A14 protein component of viral membranes. When the synthesis of A11 was repressed, "empty" immature-virion-like structures formed in addition to masses of viroplasm. The immature-virion-like structures were labeled with antibodies to A17 and to the D13 scaffold protein and were closely associated with calnexin-labeled ER. These studies revealed similarities and differences between A11 and L2, both of which may be involved in the recruitment of the ER for virus assembly.},

This dual expression plasmid produces a robust increase in cellular SUMOylation, therefore facilitating the characterization of cellular and viral SUMO targets.

abstract = {Many mammalian mRNAs possess long 5' UTRs with numerous stem-loop structures. For some of them, the presence of Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRESes) was suggested to explain their significant activity, especially when cap-dependent translation is compromised. To test this hypothesis, we have compared the translation initiation efficiencies of some cellular 5' UTRs reported to have IRES-activity with those lacking IRES-elements in RNA-transfected cells and cell-free systems. Unlike viral IRESes, the tested 5' UTRs with so-called 'cellular IRESes' demonstrate only background activities when placed in the intercistronic position of dicistronic RNAs. In contrast, they are very active in the monocistronic context and the cap is indispensable for their activities. Surprisingly, in cultured cells or cytoplasmic extracts both the level of stimulation with the cap and the overall translation activity do not correlate with the cumulative energy of the secondary structure of the tested 5' UTRs. The cap positive effect is still observed under profound inhibition of translation with eIF4E-BP1 but its magnitude varies for individual 5' UTRs irrespective of the cumulative energy of their secondary structures. Thus, it is not mandatory to invoke the IRES hypothesis, at least for some mRNAs, to explain their preferential translation when eIF4E is partially inactivated.},

The 3'UTR interacts with 40S ribosomal subunit proteins residing primarily in a localized region on the 40S solvent-accessible surface near the messenger RNA entry and exit sites. This region partially overlaps with the site where the HCV internal ribosome entry site was found to bind, with the internal ribosome entry site-40S subunit interaction being dominant. Despite its ability to bind to 40S subunits independently, the HCV 3'UTR only stimulates translation in cis, without affecting the first round translation rate. These observations support a model in which the HCV 3'UTR retains ribosome complexes during translation termination to facilitate efficient initiation of subsequent rounds of translation.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus NS1 protein affects virulence through several mechanisms, including the host's innate immune response and various signaling pathways. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype continue to evolve through reassortment and mutations. Our recent phylogenetic analysis identified a group of HPAI H5N1 viruses with two characteristic mutations in NS1: the avian virus-type PDZ domain-binding motif ESEV (which affects virulence) was replaced with ESKV, and NS1-138F (which is highly conserved among all influenza A viruses and may affect the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3K]/Akt signaling pathway) was replaced with NS1-138Y. Here, we show that an HPAI H5N1 virus (A/duck/Hunan/69/2004) encoding NS1-ESKV and NS1-138Y was confined to the respiratory tract of infected mice, whereas a mutant encoding NS1-ESEV and NS1-138F caused systemic infection and killed mice more efficiently. Mutation of either one of these sites had small effects on virulence. In addition, we found that the amino acid at NS1-138 affected not only the induction of the PI3K/Akt pathway but also the interaction of NS1 with cellular PDZ domain proteins. Similarly, the mutation in the PDZ domain-binding motif of NS1 altered its binding to cellular PDZ domain proteins and affected Akt phosphorylation. These findings suggest a functional interplay between the mutations at NS1-138 and NS1-229 that results in a synergistic effect on influenza virulence.},

Cell-free translation is central to the ribosome display process and is performed in such a way that the ribosome provides the link between genotype and phenotype that allows genes encoding proteins with desired properties to be identified by selection. Prokaryotic cell-free translation reagents, based initially on E. coli cell extracts and more recently containing purified and recombinant factors, have dominated the ribosome display literature. Eukaryotic cell extracts are also suitable for ribosome display; however, protocols for prokaryotic ribosome display are not directly transferable to the use of eukaryotic cell extracts.

abstract = {While the nonstructural gene (NS) of the influenza A virus plays a crucial role in viral virulence and replication, the complete understanding of its molecular phylogeny and evolutionary dynamics remains lacking. In this study, the phylogenetic analysis of 7581 NS sequences revealed ten distinct lineages within alleles A and B: three host-specific (human, classical swine and equine), two reassortment-originated (A(H1N1)pdm09 and triple reassortment swine), one transmission-originated (Eurasian swine), and two geographically isolated avian (Eurasian/Oceanian and North American) for allele A and two geographically isolated avian (Eurasian/Oceanian and North American) for allele B. The average nucleotide substitution rates of the lineages range from 1.24x10(-3) (equine) to 4.34x10(-3) (A(H1N1)pdm09) substitutions per site per year. The selection pressure analysis demonstrated that the dN/dS ratio of the NS gene in A(H1N1)pdm09 lineage was higher than its closely related triple reassortant swine, which could be attributed to the adaptation to the new host and/or intensive surveillance after the inter-species transmission from swine to human. The positive selection sites were found in all lineages except the equine lineage and mostly in the NS1 region. The positive selection sites 22, 26, 226, 227 and 230 of the human lineage are significant because these residues participate in either forming the dimerization of the two RNA binding domain (RBD) monomers or blocking the replication of host genes. Residues at position 171 provide hydrophobic interactions with hydrophobic residues at p85beta and thus induce viral cell growth. The lineages and evolutionary dynamics of influenza A NS gene obtained in this study, along with the studies of other gene segments, are expected to improve the early detection of new viruses and thus have the potential to enhance influenza surveillance.},

abstract = {The influenza virus nonstructural protein 1 encoded by influenza A virus (NS1A protein) is a multifunctional protein involved in both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. NS1A binds nonspecifically to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and to specific protein targets, and regulates several post-transcriptional processes. The N-terminal structural domain corresponding to the first 73 amino acids of the NS1 protein from influenza A/Udorn/72 virus [NS1A(1-73)] possesses all of the dsRNA binding activities of the full-length protein. Both NMR and X-ray crystallography of this domain have demonstrated that it is a symmetric homodimer which forms a six-helix chain fold, a unique structure that differs from that of the predominant class of dsRNA-binding domains, termed dsRBDs, that are found in a large number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins. Here we describe biophysical experiments on complexes containing NS1A(1-73) and a short 16 bp synthetic dsRNA duplex. From sedimentation equilibrium measurements, we determined that the dimeric NS1A(1-73) binds to the dsRNA duplex with a 1:1 stoichiometry, yielding a complex with an apparent dissociation constant (K(d)) of approximately 1 microM. Circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data demonstrate that the conformations of both NS1A(1-73) and dsRNA in the complex are similar to their free forms, indicating little or no structural change in the protein or RNA upon complex formation. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments show that the dsRNA-binding epitope of NS1A(1-73) is associated with helices 2 and 2'. Analytical gel filtration and gel shift studies of the interaction between NS1A(1-73) and different double-stranded nucleic acids indicate that NS1A(1-73) recognizes canonical A-form dsRNA, but does not bind to dsDNA or dsRNA-DNA hybrids, which feature B-type or A/B-type intermediate conformations, respectively. On the basis of these results, we propose a three-dimensional model of the complex in which NS1A(1-73) sits astride the minor groove of A-form RNA with a few amino acids in the helix 2-helix 2' face forming an electrostatically stabilized interaction with the phosphodiester backbone. This mode of dsRNA binding differs from that observed for any other dsRNA-binding protein.},

abstract = {Initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) is phosphorylated in vitro by two different cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinases. As previously shown, a protein kinase activity that comigrates with the major casein kinase activity from rabbit reticulocytes phosphorylates eIF-2beta. In addition, a second protein kinase that specifically phosphorylates eIF-2alpha has been identified. Both protein kinase activities demonstrate cyclic nucleotide-independent activity and are not inhibited by the inhibitor protein diagnostic for cyclic AMP-regulated protein kinase activities. Phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha is almost completely inhibited by 20--35 muM hemin, whereas phosphorylation of eIF-2beta is only partially inhibited. Hemin acts by decreasing the rate of incorporation of phosphate into eIF-2alpha. The protein kinase activity that modifies eIF-2alpha has been shown to have inhibitory activity in the cell-free protein-synthesizing system, whereas the protein kinase for eIF-2beta has no effect. The identity of the former enzyme with the hemin-controlled repressor and role of hemin in the control of initiation are discussed.},

abstract = {Translation directed by the poliovirus (PV) or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is very inefficient when expressed from Sindbis virus (SV) replicons. This inhibition can be rescued by co-expression of PV 2A protease (2A(pro)). Inhibition correlates with the extensive phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2alpha induced by SV replication. Confirmation that PV or EMCV IRES-driven translation can function when eIF2alpha is not phosphorylated was obtained in dsRNA-activated protein kinase knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PKR(-/-) MEFs), where SV replication cannot induce eIF2alpha phosphorylation, and in variant S51A MEFs that express an unphosphorylatable eIF2alpha. In these cells, PV or EMCV IRES-dependent translation operated more efficiently than in wild-type MEFs. However, this translation was potently blocked when eIF2alpha was phosphorylated by the addition of thapsigargin to PKR(-/-) MEFs. In addition, when wild-type eIF2alpha was expressed in S51A MEFs or PKR was expressed in PKR(-/-) MEFs, PV IRES-dependent translation decreased. In both cases, the decrease in PV IRES-dependent translation correlated with the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Notably, PV 2A(pro) expression rescued PV IRES-driven translation in thapsigargin-treated PKR(-/-) MEFs. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PV IRES-driven translation can take place from SV replicons if eIF2alpha remains unphosphorylated. Remarkably, PV IRES-dependent translation was fully functional in this system when PV 2A(pro) was present, even if eIF2alpha was phosphorylated.},

Classical genetic approaches for studying the role of PKR in cell signaling have their limitations due to overlapping but non-redundant pathways. Small molecule inhibitors of PKR will be useful in this regard. We report here, the discovery of a small molecule inhibitor of the kinase reaction of PKR. The inhibitor was discovered by screening a library of 26 different ATP-binding site directed inhibitors of varying structure. We also describe the development of a high-throughput assay for screening a large number of compounds for a PKR inhibitor using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and luciferase mRNA. The assay takes advantage of the fact that the reticulocyte lysate is rich in components of the translational machinery, of which PKR is an integral part. This assay can be carried out with added exogenous human PKR to study the effect of various compounds in their ability to rescue the translational block imposed by human PKR.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Ocular involvement in influenza A virus diseases is common but usually limited to mild conjunctivitis. Rarely, inflammation of the choriocapillaris may result in atrophia of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Primary human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were infected with seasonal (H1N1 A/New Caledonia/20/99, H3N2 A/California/7/2004) or highly pathogenic avian H5N1 (A/Thailand/1(Kan-1)/04, A/Vietnam/1203/04, A/Vietnam/1194/04) influenza strains. METHODS: Influenza A virus replication was studied by investigation of cytopathogenic effects, immune staining for influenza A virus nucleoprotein, determination of virus titers, and electron microscopy. Apoptosis induction was examined by immune staining for activated caspase 3 and cleaved PARP. Proinflammatory gene expression was investigated by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: H5N1 but not seasonal influenza strains replicated to high titers (>10(8) TCID(50)/mL; 50\% tissue culture infectious dose/milliliter) in RPE cells. H5N1 infection resulted in RPE cell apoptosis that was abolished by the antiviral drug ribavirin. Pretreatment with type I interferons (interferon-alpha and -beta) or the type II interferon, (interferon-gamma), inhibited H5N1 replication. Moreover, H5N1 infection induced expression of proinflammatory genes (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CXCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11, and interleukin-6), which was inhibited by ribavirin in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: A novel cell type derived from the central nervous system was permissive to H5N1 influenza virus replication. This findings supports those suggesting H5N1 influenza strains to own a greater potential to spread to nonrespiratory tissues than seasonal human influenza viruses. Moreover, the data warrant the further study of the role of influenza A virus replication in retinal diseases associated with influenza A virus infections.},

abstract = {The NS1 protein of the influenza A/Udorn/72 virus possesses two important functional domains: an RNA-binding domain near the amino-terminal end and an effector domain in the carboxyl half of the molecule. Though the NS1 proteins of influenza A and B viruses share little sequence homology, an RNA-binding domain with the same activities is preserved in the NS1 protein of influenza B/LEE/40 virus. The RNA-binding domains of the NS1 proteins of these influenza A and B viruses share the following properties: (i) they specifically bind to the same three RNA targets, poly(A), U6 snRNA, and double-stranded (ds) RNA; (ii) a polypeptide containing an amino-terminal sequence of the protein possesses all the RNA-binding activity of the full-length protein and exists in the form of a dimer; (iii) the binding to U6 snRNA causes an inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing in vitro; and (iv) the binding to dsRNA blocks the activation of the PKR kinase in vitro. The conservation of the RNA-binding domain of the NS1 protein among influenza A and B viruses strongly suggests that this domain is required for the replication of all these influenza viruses. In contrast, the NS1 protein of influenza B virus (NS1B protein) lacks an effector domain that functions like that of the NS1 protein of influenza A virus (NS1A protein). The effector domain of the NS1A protein is required for two of its in vivo activities: the inhibition of the nuclear export of poly(A)-containing mRNA and the inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing. The NS1B protein lacks these two in vivo activities. In addition, a naturally occurring, truncated NS1A protein lacks such an effector domain. Consequently, an effector domain that functions like that of full-length NS1A proteins is not absolutely required for the replication of influenza A and B viruses. We discuss the implications of these results for the roles of the RNA-binding and effector domains of the NS1 protein during infection by influenza A and B viruses.},

abstract = {NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) is an important virulence factor of the influenza A virus. We observed that NS1 proteins of the 1918 pandemic virus (A/Brevig Mission/1/18) and many avian influenza A viruses contain a consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding motif. Screening of a comprehensive human SH3 phage library revealed the N-terminal SH3 of Crk and CrkL as the preferred binding partners. Studies with recombinant proteins confirmed avid binding of NS1 proteins of the 1918 virus and a representative avian H7N3 strain to Crk/CrkL SH3 but not to other SH3 domains tested, including p85alpha and p85beta. Endogenous CrkL readily co-precipitated NS1 from cells infected with the H7N3 virus. In transfected cells association with CrkL was observed for NS1 of the 1918 and H7N3 viruses but not A/Udorn/72 or A/WSN/33 NS1 lacking this sequence motif. SH3 binding was dispensable for suppression of interferon-induced gene expression by NS1 but was associated with enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, as evidenced by increased Akt phosphorylation. Thus, the Spanish Flu virus resembles avian influenza A viruses in its ability to recruit Crk/CrkL to modulate host cell signaling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Influenza A pandemic sustained by a new H1N1 variant (H1N1v) started in Mexico and the USA at the end of April 2009 spreading worldwide in a few weeks. In this study we investigate the variability of the NS1 gene of the pandemic H1N1v strain with respect to previous seasonal strains circulating in humans and the potential selection of virus variants through isolation in cell culture. METHODS: During the period April 27th 2009-Jan 15th 2010, 1633 potential 2009 H1N1v cases have been screened at our center using the CDC detection and typing realtime RT-PCR assays. Virus isolation on MDCK cells was systematically performed in 1/10 positive cases. A subset of 51 H1N1v strains isolated in the period May-September 2009 was selected for NS1 gene sequencing. In addition, 15 H1N1 and 47 H3N2 virus isolates from three previous seasonal epidemics (2006-2009) were analyzed in parallel. RESULTS: A low variability in the NS1 amino acid (aa) sequence among H1N1v isolates was shown (aa identity 99.5\%). A slightly higher NS1 variability was observed among H1N1 and H3N2 strains from previous epidemics (aa identity 98.6\% and 98.9\%, respectively). The H1N1v strains were closely related (aa identity 92.1\%) to swine reference strain (A/swine/Oklahoma/042169/2008). In contrast, substantial divergence (aa identity 83.4\%) with respect to human reference strain A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 and previous epidemic strains H1N1 and H3N2 (aa identity 78.9\% and 77.6\%, respectively) was shown. Specific sequence signatures of uncertain significance in the new virus variant were a C-terminus deletion and a T215P substitution. CONCLUSIONS: The H1N1v NS1 gene was more conserved than that of previous epidemic strains. In addition, a closer genetic identity of H1N1v with the swine than the human reference strains was shown. Hot-spots were shown in the H1N1v NS1 aa sequence whose biologic relevance remains to be investigated.},

abstract = {When rabbit reticulocyte lysates are incubated in the absence of hemin or in the presence of low concentrations of double-stranded RNA, the rate of initiation of protein synthesis is severely reduced after a lag period in which control rates are observed. This reduced initiation rate is due to inhibition of the binding of Methionyl-tRNAf to native 40S ribosomal subunits and is caused by a macromolecular inhibitor which is activated under these conditions. This paper shows that the inhibitors activated in these two situations appear to be different entities, but that in both cases, the inhibitor has an associated protein kinase activity which is highly selective for the small subunit of elF-2, the initiation factor which catalyzes binding of Methionyl-tRNAf to 40S subunits. We present several lines of evidence in support of the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of elF-2 by these kinases is basis of the control of initiation in lysates incubated under these conditions.},

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of commercially available pre-procedural mouthrinses containing 0.2 \% chlorhexidine gluconate, a herbal mouthwash and water in reducing the levels of viable bacteria in aerosols. Methods: This was a single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized, three-group parallel design and conducted over a period of 45 days. 24 patients with chronic periodontitis were divided randomly into three groups (A,B,C) of 8 patients each to be administered with 0.2 \% chlorhexidine gluconate, herbal mouthwash and water respectively, as a pre-procedural rinse. The aerosol produced by the ultrasonic unit was collected at patient's chest area, doctor's chest area and assistant's chest area on blood agar plates in all the three groups. The blood agar plates were incubated at 37o Celsius for 48 hours and the total number of colony- forming units (CFU) were counted and statistically analyzed. Results: The results showed that CFU in group A and group B were significantly reduced when compared to group C with P-value = 0.000 (ANOVA). Also, CFU in group A was significantly reduced when compared to group B with P-value < 0.05 (Independent t-test). The numbers of CFU were highest at patient's chest area and least on assistant's chest area. Conclusion: This study suggests that a routine pre-procedural mouthrinse could eliminate the majority of bacterial aerosols generated by the use of ultrasonic unit and 0.2\% chlorhexidine gluconate was more effective than herbal mouthwash.},

Cell-free (CF) or in vitro expression systems offer an elegant alternative route to cell based protein expression, as the functional expression of membrane proteins can be directly achieved from the genetic template without the need of cell cultivation and protein isolation. Here we investigated in detail the cell-free expression and membrane insertion of the olfactory receptor OR5 in dependence of different experimental conditions like probing different origins of the cell-free expression system (from bacteria, via plants and insects toward mammalian system) and lipid composition of the respective extracts. We provided substantial biochemical indications by radioactive labeling based on [35S]-methionine, followed by proteolytic digestion, and we found that the insertion of the olfactory receptor OR5 into liposomes resulted in an unidirectional orientation with the binding side exposed into the aqueous space, resembling the native orientation in the cilia of the olfactory neurons. We report the different results in synthesis capacity for the different in vitro systems employed as we like to demonstrate the first in vitro kit toward and ex situ and ex vivo odorant receptor array.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus NEP (NS2) protein is an structural component of the viral particle. To investigate whether this protein has an effect on viral RNA synthesis, we examined the expression of an influenza A virus-like chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) RNA in cells synthesizing the four influenza A virus core proteins (nucleoprotein, PB1, PB2, and PA) and NEP from recombinant plasmids. Influenza A virus NEP inhibited drastically, and in a dose-dependent manner, the level of CAT expression mediated by the recombinant influenza A virus polymerase. This inhibitory effect was not observed in an analogous artificial system in which expression of a synthetic CAT RNA is mediated by the core proteins of an influenza B virus. This result ruled out the possibility that inhibition of reporter gene expression was due to a general toxic effect induced by NEP. Analysis of the virus-specific RNA species that accumulated in cells expressing the type A recombinant core proteins and NEP showed that there was an important reduction in the levels of minireplicon-derived vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA molecules. Taken together, the results obtained suggest a regulatory role for NEP during virus-specific RNA synthesis, and this finding is discussed regarding the biological implications for the virus life cycle.},

abstract = {Influenza is a continuing world-wide public health problem that causes significant morbidity and mortality during seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. The existing vaccination program is variably effective from year to year, and drug resistance to available antivirals is a growing problem, making the development of additional antivirals an important challenge. Influenza virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is the centerpiece of the viral response to the host interferon (IFN) system. NS1 was demonstrated previously to be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral therapy by the identification of specific small-molecule inhibitors. One inhibitory compound, NSC125044, was subjected to chemical evaluation. Initial synthetic work comprised simplifying the core structure by removing unwanted functionality and determination of key features important for activity. Several subclasses of molecules were designed and synthesized to further probe activity and develop the basis for a structure-activity relationship. Apparent potency, as judged by activity in virus replication assays, increased dramatically for some analogs, without cytotoxicity. Results suggest that the target binding site tolerates hydrophobic bulk as well as having a preference for weakly basic substituents.},

@article{Donelan2003,
abstract = {Previously we found that the amino-terminal region of the NS1 protein of influenza A virus plays a key role in preventing the induction of beta interferon (IFN-beta) in virus-infected cells. This region is characterized by its ability to bind to different RNA species, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a known potent inducer of IFNs. In order to investigate whether the NS1 RNA-binding activity is required for its IFN antagonist properties, we have generated a recombinant influenza A virus which expresses a mutant NS1 protein defective in dsRNA binding. For this purpose, we substituted alanines for two basic amino acids within NS1 (R38 and K41) that were previously found to be required for RNA binding. Cells infected with the resulting recombinant virus showed increased IFN-beta production, demonstrating that these two amino acids play a critical role in the inhibition of IFN production by the NS1 protein during viral infection. In addition, this virus grew to lower titers than wild-type virus in MDCK cells, and it was attenuated in mice. Interestingly, passaging in MDCK cells resulted in the selection of a mutant virus containing a third mutation at amino acid residue 42 of the NS1 protein (S42G). This mutation did not result in a gain in dsRNA-binding activity by the NS1 protein, as measured by an in vitro assay. Nevertheless, the NS1 R38AK41AS42G mutant virus was able to replicate in MDCK cells to titers close to those of wild-type virus. This mutant virus had intermediate virulence in mice, between those of the wild-type and parental NS1 R38AK41A viruses. These results suggest not only that the IFN antagonist properties of the NS1 protein depend on its ability to bind dsRNA but also that they can be modulated by amino acid residues not involved in RNA binding.},

abstract = {The influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase interacts with the serine-5 phosphorylated carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). It was proposed that this interaction allows the viral RNA polymerase to gain access to host mRNA-derived capped RNA fragments required as primers for the initiation of viral mRNA synthesis. Here, we show, using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, that similar amounts of Pol II associate with Pol II promoter DNAs in influenza virus-infected and mock-infected cells. However, there is a statistically significant reduction in Pol II densities in the coding region of Pol II genes in infected cells. Thus, influenza virus specifically interferes with Pol II elongation, but not Pol II initiation. We propose that influenza virus RNA polymerase, by binding to the CTD of initiating Pol II and subsequent cleavage of the capped 5' end of the nascent transcript, triggers premature Pol II termination.},

@article{Fixsen2010,
abstract = {Selenoproteins are a family of proteins that share the common feature of containing selenocysteine, the "twenty-first" amino acid. Selenocysteine incorporation occurs during translation of selenoprotein messages by redefinition of UGA codons, which normally specify termination of translation. Studies of the eukaryotic selenocysteine incorporation mechanism suggest that selenocysteine insertion is inefficient compared with termination. Nevertheless, selenoprotein P and several other selenoproteins are known to contain multiple selenocysteines. The production of full-length (FL) protein from these messages would seem to demand highly efficient selenocysteine incorporation due to the compounding effect of termination at each UGA codon. We present data demonstrating that efficient incorporation of multiple selenocysteines can be reconstituted in rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions. Selenocysteine incorporation at the first UGA codon is inefficient but increases by approximately 10-fold at subsequent downstream UGA codons. We found that ribosomes in the "processive" phase of selenocysteine incorporation (i.e., after decoding the first UGA codon as selenocysteine) are fully competent to terminate translation at UAG and UAA codons, that ribosomes become less efficient at selenocysteine incorporation as the distance between UGA codons is increased, and that efficient selenocysteine incorporation is not dependent on cis-acting elements unique to selenoprotein P. Furthermore, we found that the percentage of ribosomes decoding a UGA codon as selenocysteine rather than termination can be increased by 3- to 5-fold by placing the murine leukemia virus UAG read-through element upstream of the first UGA codon or by providing a competing messenger RNA in trans. The mechanisms of selenocysteine incorporation and selenoprotein synthesis are discussed in light of these results.},

Here, we have analysed the binding of RNPs, M1 and NS2/NEP proteins to purified nucleosomes, reconstituted histone octamers and purified single histones. RNPs and M1 both bind to the chromatin components but at two different sites, RNP to the histone tails and M1 to the globular domain of the histone octamer. NS2/NEP did not bind to nucleosomes at all. The possible consequences of these findings for nuclear release of newly made RNPs and for other processes during the infection cycle are discussed.},

The screen validated saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe) and identified two novel anti-IAV agents, obatoclax and gemcitabine. Further experiments demonstrated that Mcl-1 (target of obatoclax) provides a novel host target for IAV treatment. Moreover, we showed that obatoclax and SaliPhe inhibited IAV uptake and gemcitabine suppressed viral RNA transcription and replication. These compounds possess broad spectrum antiviral activity, although their antiviral efficacies were virus-, cell type-, and species-specific. Altogether, our results suggest that phase II obatoclax, investigational SaliPhe, and FDA/EMEA-approved gemcitabine represent potent antiviral agents.},

abstract = {Influenza A NS1 and NS2 proteins are encoded by the RNA segment 8 of the viral genome. NS1 is a multifunctional protein and a virulence factor while NS2 is involved in nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes. A yeast two-hybrid screening strategy was used to identify host factors supporting NS1 and NS2 functions. More than 560 interactions between 79 cellular proteins and NS1 and NS2 proteins from 9 different influenza virus strains have been identified. These interacting proteins are potentially involved in each step of the infectious process and their contribution to viral replication was tested by RNA interference. Validation of the relevance of these host cell proteins for the viral replication cycle revealed that 7 of the 79 NS1 and/or NS2-interacting proteins positively or negatively controlled virus replication. One of the main factors targeted by NS1 of all virus strains was double-stranded RNA binding domain protein family. In particular, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) appeared as a pro-viral host factor whose expression is necessary for optimal viral protein synthesis and replication. Surprisingly, ADAR1 also appeared as a pro-viral host factor for dengue virus replication and directly interacted with the viral NS3 protein. ADAR1 editing activity was enhanced by both viruses through dengue virus NS3 and influenza virus NS1 proteins, suggesting a similar virus-host co-evolution.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus genome consists of eight RNA segments that associate with the viral polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA) and nucleoprotein (NP) to form ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). The viral NS1 protein was previously shown to associate with these complexes, although it was not clear which RNP component mediated the interaction. Using individual TAP (tandem affinity purification)-tagged PB1, PB2, PA, and NP, we demonstrated that the NS1 protein interacts specifically with NP and not the polymerase subunits. The region of NS1 that binds NP was mapped to the RNA-binding domain.},

@article{Mibayashi2007,
abstract = {The retinoic acid-inducible gene I product (RIG-I) has been identified as a cellular sensor of RNA virus infection resulting in beta interferon (IFN-beta) induction. However, many viruses are known to encode viral products that inhibit IFN-beta production. In the case of influenza A virus, the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) prevents the induction of the IFN-beta promoter by inhibiting the activation of transcription factors, including IRF-3, involved in IFN-beta transcriptional activation. The inhibitory properties of NS1 appear to be due at least in part to its binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), resulting in the sequestration of this viral mediator of RIG-I activation. However, the precise effects of NS1 on the RIG-I-mediated induction of IFN-beta have not been characterized. We now report that the NS1 of influenza A virus interacts with RIG-I and inhibits the RIG-I-mediated induction of IFN-beta. This inhibition was apparent even when a mutant RIG-I that is constitutively activated (in the absence of dsRNA) was used to trigger IFN-beta production. Coexpression of RIG-I, its downstream signaling partner, IPS-1, and NS1 resulted in increased levels of RIG-I and NS1 within an IPS-1-rich, solubilization-resistant fraction after cell lysis. These results suggest that RIG-I, IPS-1, and NS1 become part of the same complex. Consistent with this idea, NS1 was also found to inhibit IFN-beta promoter activation by IPS-1 overexpression. Our results indicate that, in addition to sequestering dsRNA, the NS1 of influenza A virus binds to RIG-I and inhibits downstream activation of IRF-3, preventing the transcriptional induction of IFN-beta.},

abstract = {We present evidence, based on extensive mutagenesis, that a hairpin loop at the 5' end of influenza A virus virion RNA (vRNA) is required for the synthesis of polyadenylated mRNA from model vRNA templates in vitro. The hairpin loop, which we term the vRNA 5' hook, contains a stem of 2 bp formed by the second and third residues pairing with the ninth and eighth residues, respectively, and a 4-nucleotide loop composed of the intervening residues 4 to 7. Disruption of the base pairs of the vRNA 5' hook by introducing point mutations prevented polyadenylation, except in two mutants where a G-U base pair reformed. The polyadenylation activity of point mutants could be rescued by constructing double mutants with reformed base pairs in the stem of the vRNA 5' hook. These results suggest that base pairing rather than a particular nucleotide sequence was critical. We also show that mutation of the analogous region in the 3' arm of vRNA did not interfere with the synthesis of polyadenylated mRNA, suggesting that a hook structure in the 3' arm is not required for transcription of polyadenylated mRNA in vitro.},

abstract = {The NS1 influenza virus gene is thought to play an important role in replication and pathogenicity during infection. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the highly pathogenic avian NS1 influenza virus gene can influence virulence. However, little is known regarding the pathogenic mechanism of the NS1 gene in low pathogenic avian influenza virus. We found that NS1 genes originating from two H3 avian influenza viruses, A/duck/Beijing/40/04 (Dk/BJ/40/04) and A/duck/Beijing/61/05 (Dk/BJ/61/05), possessing three amino acid residue differences at positions 127, 205 and 209 contributed to an altered virulence in rescued NS1 recombinant viruses on a A/WSN/33 (WSN) virus background (WSN:40NS1 and WSN:61NS1) in mice. To further determine the effect on pathogenicity, we generated a series of recombinant viruses with mutations at positions 127, 205 and 209 in the NS1 gene of WSN:61NS1. Experiments in mice indicated that when compared with WSN:61NS1, viruses with only single mutations enhanced incidence of infection in mice but were not lethal. Viruses bearing substitution of two amino acid residues in the NS1 protein replicated well in lung tissue and caused 20-100\% mortality in mice. Our findings demonstrate that co-mutation of amino acid residues at multiple positions in the NS1 protein can increase the pathogenicity of influenza virus in mice.},

abstract = {Primer-independent cDNA synthesis during reverse transcription hinders quantitative analysis of bidirectional mRNA synthesis in eukaryotes as well as in cells infected with RNA viruses. We report a simple RT-PCR-based assay for strand-specific gene-expression analysis. By modifying the cDNA sequence during reverse transcription, the opposite strands of target sequences can be simultaneously detected by postamplification melting curve analysis and primer-initiated transcripts are readily distinguished from nonspecifically primed cDNA. We have utilized this technique to optimize the specificity of reverse transcription on a panel of 15 target genes. Primer-independent reverse transcription occurred for all target sequences when reverse transcription was performed at 42°C and accounted for 11\%-57\% of the final PCR amplification products. By raising the reaction temperature to 55°C, the specificity of reverse transcription could be increased without significant loss of sensitivity. We have also demonstrated the utility of this technique for analysis of (+) and (-) RNA synthesis of influenza A virus in infected cells. Thus, this technique represents a powerful tool for analysis of bidirectional RNA synthesis.},

abstract = {At the global level, influenza A virus (IAV) is considered a major health threat because it causes significant morbidity. Different treatment and prevention options have been developed; however, these are insufficient in the face of recent IAV outbreaks. In particular, available antiviral agents have limited effectiveness owing to IAV resistance to these virus-directed drugs. Recent advances in understanding of IAV replication have revealed a number of cellular drug targets that counteract viral drug resistance. This review summarizes current knowledge on IAV replication with a focus on emerging cellular drug targets. Interestingly, for many of these targets, compounds for which safety testing has been carried out in humans are available. It is possible that some of these compounds, such as inhibitors of heat shock protein 90, proteasome, importin $\alpha$5 or protein kinase C, will be used for treatment of IAV infections after careful evaluation in human primary cells and severely ill flu patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
